"""The load-order sort engine.

Places the user's custom plugins into a frozen curated order without ever
reordering the curated portion. That constraint is the whole point of the tool:
a MOMW list is a tested artefact, and a "better" order is still a broken one if
it is not the order the list authors validated.

Pinned by ``tests/test_differential.py`` against a real 687-plugin order,
including that sorting with no custom mods returns the curated order
byte-identical and that repeated sorts agree.

The body was relocated from the engine module verbatim, and typed in a
*separate* later pass. Doing both at once would have made a behaviour change
indistinguishable from a relocation error, in the one function whose output is
the product.

    The curated portion is never reordered. That is the tool's entire purpose:
    a MOMW list is a tested artefact, and an order its authors did not validate
    is a broken one even if some rule says it is "better". Custom plugins are
    positioned around that fixed spine using the mlox ordering rules, with
    master files kept ahead of ordinary plugins.

    Sorting with no custom plugins returns ``base_order_names`` unchanged, and
    repeated sorts of the same input agree. Both properties are pinned against
    a real 687-plugin order by ``tests/test_differential.py``.

    Args:
        base_order_names: The curated ``content=`` order, treated as frozen.
            A ``list`` specifically: it is concatenated to build the node pool.
        subset_names: The user's own plugins to place. Entries matching a base
            plugin under different casing are canonicalised onto the base
            spelling and de-duplicated -- OpenMW's VFS is case-insensitive, so
            ``NewMod.esp`` and ``newmod.esp`` are one file, and treating them
            as two graph nodes would insert the plugin twice.
        rule_blocks: ``(names, priority)`` ordering chains from ``[Order]``
            blocks. Chains are kept whole so an uninstalled middle plugin acts
            as a bridge rather than dropping the constraint.
        masters: ``{plugin: required masters}``, used to keep a plugin after
            everything it depends on.
        nearstart: Plugins to pull toward the start, as far as constraints
            allow. Position hints, not an ordering chain.
        nearend: Plugins to pull toward the end, likewise.
        anchor_out: If given, receives ``{plugin: (how, anchor)}`` -- ``anchor``
            is ``None`` when the plugin had no positioning signal -- describing
            why each custom plugin landed where it did -- used to annotate the
            emitted TOML. **Mutated in place.**

    Returns:
        The full plugin order: every base plugin in its original relative
        position, with the custom plugins placed among them.
