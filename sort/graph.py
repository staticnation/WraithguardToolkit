Small, pure helpers underneath :func:`~wraithguard.sort.engine.build_and_sort`:
expanding a rule's plugin pattern to the plugins actually present, detecting
whether a proposed edge would close a cycle, and recognising master files.

Nothing here touches plugin files or rule text, which is what makes it
