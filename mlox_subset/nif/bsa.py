r"""Reading Morrowind's BSA archives, which is where most of the game lives.

The base game ships nearly all of its meshes and textures inside
``Morrowind.bsa``, so a vanilla asset resolves to nothing on disk while the
engine finds it perfectly well. Without this, every base-game mesh looks
untextured and every base-game texture looks missing -- both false, and both on
the lines a user acts on.

**Morrowind's BSA is not Bethesda's later BSA.** The archives shipped with
Oblivion and everything after begin with the magic ``BSA\\0`` and use a folder
tree, compression and different hashing. Morrowind's begins with a version word
of ``0x100`` and is a flat table of names and offsets. Only the older format is
handled here, and one of the other kind is refused by name rather than
misparsed: they share an extension and nothing else.

**Why this is written rather than imported.** The obvious library,
``bethesda-structs``, is MIT and so would have been usable -- but it pulls in
``construct``, ``multidict``, ``attrs`` and ``lz4`` (the last with a compiled
extension), ships a 49 MB tree covering Fallout and Skyrim record formats this
project will never touch, and every BSA in its own test suite is the *later*
format. The Morrowind layout is a header and three tables. This is the same
trade the NIF reader, the DDS decoder and the PNG encoder all make.
