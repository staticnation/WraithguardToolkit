"""A reference block listing built without using any field layout.

The layout reader in :mod:`mlox_subset.nif.reader` walks a file by knowing how
wide every field is. That makes it useful and it makes it fallible in a
specific way: one wrong width desynchronises everything after it, and the
result is not an exception but a plausible-looking answer. Checking that answer
needs a second opinion that cannot fail the same way.

This module is that second opinion. It uses one fact about the format -- **a
block's type name is stored as a 32-bit length followed by that many bytes** --
and never advances by a field width or consults
:data:`~mlox_subset.nif.blocks.BLOCK_LAYOUTS`, so it cannot inherit a layout
bug. Where the two agree, the layouts are right. Where they disagree, the scan
says which block *index* the disagreement starts at, and the block before it is
the one whose width is wrong.

**That fact alone is not sufficient, and the code says so because measuring it
proved it.** Every string in a NIF is length-prefixed -- block names, texture
paths, extra data -- so the invariant matches a node called ``Bip01`` exactly
as well as it matches a type name. Scanning on it alone over-counted 522 of 556
corpus files. A second filter is therefore applied: a type name must also
follow NIF's naming convention (:data:`_TYPE_CONVENTION`). That takes
reconciliation to 553 of 556.

This is a real trade and worth naming. The scan can no longer discover a block
type named arbitrarily; it can discover any type named the way every type in
this format is named. Since the purpose is to audit a reader for a single
shipped game version, that is the right side of the trade -- but it is why the
scan is a cross-check and not an oracle.

**It checks itself.** The header declares how many blocks the file holds, so a
scan finding a different number is wrong and says so via
:attr:`ScanResult.reconciles` rather than quietly reporting a bad list. A
reference that might be wrong in an unmeasured way is worse than none; this one
reports its own failures per file.

This replaces an externally supplied census. That census proved to undercount
property blocks -- verified against both this scan and NifSkope -- and carried
questions about provenance that a file generated from the user's own installed
game does not.
