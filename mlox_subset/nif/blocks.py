"""Field layouts for the NIF blocks Morrowind actually ships.

Each layout is a flat tuple of ``(name, kind)`` pairs, read in order. Kinds that
depend on an earlier field name that field, so the walker can look the count or
the flag up in what it has already read -- which is the whole of the grammar
needed here, and deliberately no more. NIF's real schema has conditionals,
version ranges and inheritance; encoding all of that would be re-implementing
``nif.xml``, and the point of restricting to one game version is that the
resulting layouts are flat.

**Inheritance is expanded, not modelled.** ``NiNode`` is written out as
``NiAVObject``'s fields followed by its own, because a block is a byte stream
and the reader only ever walks forward. Sharing is done with tuple
concatenation, which keeps the duplication out of the data without introducing
a class hierarchy that would have to be resolved at parse time.

**Coverage is measured against the engine, not against a wish list.** The
Morrowind engine supports a fixed, enumerated set of NIF objects -- the
"Supported by Engine" table in the community's *Notes for Modmakers*
(``morrowind-nif.github.io``) lists them. Anything outside it cannot appear in
a mesh the game will load, so that table is the denominator: this reader is
"done" when it covers the objects that actually occur, not all 112.

Coverage is now complete for the game as shipped. Against the 7,343 meshes of
a vanilla install, ``tools/check_nif_layouts.py --verify`` reports **7,339
identical, 0 stopped early and 0 diverged**; the remaining 4 are files where
the cross-checking scan cannot reconcile with the header and so cannot act as
a reference, not files the reader struggles with.

Getting there took 21 further layouts, added one at a time, each confirmed by
landing exactly on the following type name and by agreeing with a scan that
uses no layout knowledge at all. That discipline was not ceremony: it caught a
one-byte error in ``NiGeomMorpherController`` that had been reported as a
missing block type, and it is the reason a batch of guesses was never
committed. A layout guessed wrong does not fail where the guess was.

Four blocks contain fields that could not be identified from the bytes. Those
are stepped over as *measured spans* with names that admit it --
``emitter_parameters``, ``unidentified_tail``, ``path_parameters``,
``projection`` -- because the width is what the rest of the file depends on,
and an invented field name is worse than an admitted gap: it gets believed.

**These layouts want verification against real files.** They are written from
the publicly documented format; a wrong field width does not raise, it
desynchronises the rest of the file, and the reader will usually surface that as
an unknown block type several blocks later. :func:`~mlox_subset.nif.read_nif`
reports how far it got for exactly that reason.
