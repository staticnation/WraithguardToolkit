"""Walking a Morrowind NIF file block by block.

The shape of the problem, and why the code looks like this: **a NIF block has no
length field**. Blocks are written back to back, each preceded only by its type
string, so the only way to find block *n+1* is to have parsed block *n* exactly.
There is no resynchronisation and no skipping. One wrong field width does not
raise -- it shifts every subsequent read, and the damage usually surfaces much
later as a type string that is not a type string.

Two consequences run through this module:

* **Unknown blocks stop the read.** Guessing a length, or scanning forward for
  the next plausible type name, would produce a report that looks complete and
  is not. :class:`NifFile` therefore records how many blocks were read and why
  it stopped, and a caller can say "12 of 47 blocks" rather than implying 47.
* **Every read is bounds-checked.** The files come from the internet by way of
  a mod archive; a truncated or hostile one must produce
  :class:`NifParseError`, never an exception from :mod:`struct` and never a
  silent short read.
