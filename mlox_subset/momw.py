"""Read MOMW's ``plugin-order.yml`` -- the curated-list source of truth.

Modding-OpenMW publishes, for each of its curated lists, the exact plugins in
the exact order its authors tested. This module reads that file, and everything
downstream depends on getting it right: a plugin misread as absent from a list
gets treated as one of the user's own mods and becomes eligible for
reordering, which is precisely the failure this tool exists to prevent.

``PyYAML`` is used when available and a small hand-rolled reader stands in when
it is not, so the tool keeps working as a dependency-free single file. The
fallback is intentionally narrow: it parses the shapes this specific file uses
rather than pretending to be a YAML implementation.

The relocated bodies are pinned by ``tests/test_differential.py``, which
digests the parsed entries, the per-list curated orders, and the
needs-cleaning set against the real file.

    a curated plugin as one of the user's own.
