"""Explaining a diffed field in the terms the file format uses.

The field-diff window lists tes3conv's own key names -- ``vertex_heights``,
``landscape_flags``, ``num_objects``. They are readable, but they do not say
what the field *is* in the file: how wide it should be, whether the game
requires it, or which subrecord it came out of. The schema knows all three, so
this module joins the two vocabularies.

**Where the join is uncertain, there is no join.** tes3conv's names are its own
invention and nothing states the correspondence, so the mapping below is written
out by hand and only for the record types whose JSON this project has actually
read. A key with no entry is simply not annotated -- an unlabelled field costs a
reader nothing, while a confidently *wrong* label ("this is the 12-byte NPC
data") would send them looking in the wrong place.

Struct decoding is deliberately absent: tes3conv already expands struct
subrecords into JSON objects, so re-deriving them from bytes here would add a
second, worse answer to a question already answered. The blobs that arrive
*unexpanded* -- compressed vertex data, path-grid edges -- are handled by
:mod:`mlox_subset.tes3fields.landscape` and :mod:`~.pathgrid`, which know their
compression as well as their layout.
