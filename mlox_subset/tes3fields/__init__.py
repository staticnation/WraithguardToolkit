"""Render binary TES3 record fields as readable text for the diff window.

tes3conv writes several record fields as base64 (zstd-compressed underneath):
landscape grids, path-grid edges, compiled script bytecode. In a field-by-field
diff those are useless -- two versions of a cell that differ by one vertex look
completely different, because base64 of *nearly* identical bytes is *entirely*
different text.

This package turns them back into line-per-row text so the diff is meaningful.
Scripts are handled by :mod:`mlox_subset.mwscript`; the record types here are
landscape (``LAND``) and path grids (``PGRD``).

The public entry point is :func:`text_for_field`, which the field-detail window
calls for every field and which returns ``None`` for anything it does not
handle -- so adding a record type is a change in one dict, not in the GUI.

Every decoder is **total**: a malformed field comes back as a ``;``-prefixed
explanation rather than an exception, because a viewer that dies on one bad
record is worse than one that says what went wrong in place.
