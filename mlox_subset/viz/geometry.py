"""Spatial helpers: getting world coordinates back out of conflict records.

The conflict scanner keys id-less records by their grid coordinates, because
exterior cells, ``LAND`` and ``PGRD`` records have no name to key on (see
``_tes3conv_record_key`` in the engine). That makes the id a *string* like
``"(43, -45)"`` or ``"Balmora (-3, -2)"`` -- readable, and stable across the
two scanning engines, but not directly usable as a coordinate.

This module turns those ids back into integers so conflicts can be placed on a
map. It parses rather than re-derives: the id is what the rest of the tool
already agreed the record is called, and re-deriving coordinates from the
plugin would risk the map disagreeing with the list beside it.
