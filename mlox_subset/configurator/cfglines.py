particular is not cosmetic: a ``data=`` path containing spaces behaves
differently quoted and unquoted, and the surrounding file's existing style has
to be matched rather than imposed -- rewriting every line in our preferred form
would produce a diff the user did not ask for in a file they hand-edit.

    Prefer a single-quoted TOML literal string ('...') for everything --

    exactly what a Windows path full of backslashes needs: 'C:\\Games\\...'
    is correct and readable as-is, whereas a double-quoted *basic* string
    would require every backslash doubled ("C:\\\\Games\\\\..."), which is
    not what momw-configurator/umo actually write.

    A single-line literal can hold neither a `'` (it would end the string
    early) nor a raw newline (TOML forbids one in a single-line string of
    either kind) -- an insertBlock/appendBlock value is exactly the case
    that needs a real newline. Either condition escalates to a
    triple-single-quoted multi-line literal string instead
    ('''line one\nline two'''), which tolerates both a lone `'` and
    embedded newlines (just not three quotes in a row). In the vanishingly
    unlikely case a value contains `'''` itself, fall back to a properly
    escaped double-quoted basic string as a last resort -- multi-line
    (\"\"\"...\"\"\") if a newline is also present, since a single-line basic
    string can't hold one either.
