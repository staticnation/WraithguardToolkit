"""Decoding DDS textures to plain RGBA, with no third-party dependency.

A texture conflict raises the same question a mesh conflict does -- *does the
winner actually look different?* -- and answering it needs pixels. Every Python
library that decodes DDS is either a large dependency, a wrapper around a C
library that complicates a onefile build, or licensed incompatibly with this
project. ``pydds`` is the closest fit and is GPLv3, which would relicense
everything here. The formats are arithmetic, so they are decoded here.

**What is handled.** BC1 through BC5 and BC7, plus uncompressed surfaces
described by channel masks. That covers Morrowind's own textures (BC1, BC3 and
the occasional uncompressed surface), the normal maps that current mods ship
(BC5), the single-channel height and gloss masks that come with them (BC4),
and the BC7 that OpenMW-era replacers use. BC6H is HDR, has no use in this
game, and is refused by name rather than guessed at.

**Two eras of header.** The original pixel format identifies compression with
a four-character code. Anything defined after Direct3D 10 -- BC7 included --
sets that code to ``DX10`` and puts the real format in a twenty-byte extension
header after it. Both are read; a file that says ``DX10`` and then stops is a
truncation, not a format this decoder lacks, and it says so.

**Normal maps are not colour.** BC5 stores two channels because a tangent-space
normal's third can be recomputed, and this reconstructs it -- see
:func:`_decode_two_channel`. Morrowind and OpenMW both use the **DirectX**
convention, so the green channel is *not* flipped on load. Flipping it, which
tooling written against the OpenGL convention does by default, would make every
normal map in the collection compare as different from an identical copy of
itself.

**The block formats are arithmetic, not expression.** A DXT1 block is two
16-bit colours and sixteen 2-bit indices; the decode is the interpolation the
format defines. That is a fact about the format, derived here from the public
description and checked against real files, in the same way and for the same
licensing reasons as ``mlox_subset.nif`` -- see ``NIF_PROVENANCE.md``.
