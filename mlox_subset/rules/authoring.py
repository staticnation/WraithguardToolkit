"""Writing mlox rules, to the rule-base's own standards.

The engine already *reads* every rule form (:mod:`~mlox_subset.rules.parser`,
:mod:`~mlox_subset.rules.expressions`). This module writes them, and enforces
the conventions the community guidelines set out for editors -- because a rule
that parses is not the same as a rule that is any good.

What the guidelines ask for, and what is checked here:

* **Every rule cites a source.** ``(Ref: ...)`` naming the readme, forum post or
  URL the claim came from, so someone else can check it. URLs must have
  whitespace around them, because pages that auto-link URLs otherwise swallow
  the closing parenthesis into the link.
* **Rules have the right shape.** ``[Order]`` needs two or more plugins;
  ``[Requires]`` and ``[Patch]`` take exactly a dependant and a consequent;
  ``[Conflict]`` needs two or more things to conflict.
* **[Patch] cannot express NOT.** The guidelines say so explicitly and give the
  remedy -- a ``[Conflict]`` and ``[Requires]`` pair -- so a NOT inside a patch
  is refused *with that remedy in the message*, rather than silently emitted as
  something mlox will not do.
* **An inline message cannot contain ``]``**, which would close the rule label
  early. The block form has no such limit, so an offending message is a signal
  to use the block form rather than an error.
* **[NearStart]/[NearEnd] are discouraged.** "Abuse of the [NearEnd] rule is
  frowned upon"; ordering belongs in ``[Order]``. Writing one is allowed and
  warned about.
* **Filename expansion is expensive.** ``?``, ``*`` and ``<VER>`` are supported
  and flagged, since the guidelines ask for them to be used sparingly.

Nothing here writes a file or touches Tk: rules are built, rendered and checked
as data, so the whole vocabulary is testable without a display. Severity is
carried on each problem so a caller can decide what is fatal -- the GUI refuses
to write on an error and shows warnings beside the preview.
