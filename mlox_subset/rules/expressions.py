"""Tokenise and parse the mlox predicate language.

``[Requires]``, ``[Conflict]`` and ``[Note]`` rule bodies are written in a
small lisp-like language: bracketed ``ALL``/``ANY``/``NOT`` groups over plugin
patterns, plus atomic function forms that test a plugin's version, file size or
header description.

This module covers the front half of that pipeline -- text to tokens to AST,
and rendering an AST back to readable text. It is deliberately free of any
dependency on plugin files: evaluating an AST needs to read real plugin
metadata, so that half lives with the code that can do so.

The tokeniser's one subtlety is worth stating plainly, because it is easy to
"simplify" and break: ``DESC`` and ``MWSE-LUA`` forms carry a ``/regex/`` that
may itself contain ``]`` (``[DESC /[Tt]ribunal/ Foo.esp]``). Those forms must
therefore consume the ``/.../`` part explicitly *before* looking for the
closing bracket. Naive bracket matching splits the token in the middle of the
regex and produces nonsense. ``VER`` and ``SIZE`` bodies cannot contain
brackets, so they are matched more simply.
