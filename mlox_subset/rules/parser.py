"""Parse mlox rule files into ordering blocks and position hints.

Only the ordering keywords are extracted here: ``[Order]``, ``[NearStart]``
and ``[NearEnd]``. The predicate keywords (``[Requires]``, ``[Conflict]``,
``[Note]``) are evaluated separately, after sorting.

Two distinctions carry real weight, and both were bugs before they were
rules:

* **An ``[Order]`` body is a chain; ``[NearStart]``/``[NearEnd]`` bodies are
  not.** The former means "A before B before C", the latter means "put each of
  these as near the start/end as constraints allow". Treating the hint lists as
  chains invents edges between unrelated plugins -- mlox_base's ``[NearEnd]``
  block alone would link ``Merged Objects.esp -> Mashed Lists.esp -> ...``.
* **Blocks are kept whole rather than pre-zipped into pairs.** In
  ``[Order] A, B, C`` where B is not installed, keeping the chain lets the sort
  bridge ``A -> C`` and preserve the constraint. Pre-zipping to ``A->B`` and
  ``B->C`` loses it entirely when B expands to nothing. The real mlox engine
  keeps uninstalled plugins as phantom bridge nodes for exactly this reason.
