"""GUI support package: theming, reusable widgets, smoke-test tracing.

Split out of ``mlox_subset_sort_gui.py`` during the 3.0 reconciliation pass
(CODE_REVIEW.md §16/§9.2) the same way the engine was split: bodies moved
verbatim, imports adjusted, behaviour pinned by the existing checks. The main
GUI module re-imports every name, so nothing else changed.

Unlike the rest of ``mlox_subset``, this subpackage imports :mod:`tkinter` at
module level and is therefore excluded from the hermetic suite's coverage and
from mypy gating (documented per-file in ``pyproject.toml``, like the other
relocation debt).
