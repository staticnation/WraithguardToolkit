# Wraithguard Toolkit

Sort **only your custom mods** into an existing OpenMW `openmw.cfg` using mlox
rules, **without ever reordering the curated [Modding-OpenMW.com](https://modding-openmw.com/)
(MOMW) mod list** you built with `umo` + MOMW Configurator.

The existing `content=` order in `openmw.cfg` is treated as **frozen**. This
tool only works out where *your* additions (the mods under your `custom` folder)
belong relative to that frozen list and to each other, then writes the result
back as a corrected `momw-customizations.toml` - the durable fix that survives
future Configurator rebuilds.

> This is the opposite of running a whole-list sorter like PLOX. MOMW explicitly
> warns against sorting their curated lists; this tool is built specifically so
> you don't have to.

**New here? See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for a 5-minute walkthrough.**

**Writing your own rules? See [MLOX_RULES.md](MLOX_RULES.md) for the rule syntax
and the conventions the rule-base follows.** Both open from the **Help** button
inside the program as well.

## Contents

- `wraithguard_toolkit.py` - the command-line tool and the sort engine. It imports
  from `wraithguard/` like any other caller; import library names from the
  package they live in, not from here.
- `wraithguard/` - the engine itself, split by concern: rule handling, the
  load-order sort, `openmw.cfg` reading/emitting, plugin metadata, downloads,
  compiled-script decoding, and the conflict visualisations (`viz/`, which
  renders conflicts as self-contained HTML: a world conflict map, terrain
  height differences, path-grid graphs and a rotatable 3D terrain surface with
  relief shading, contours and multidirectional lighting - see
  [The 3D terrain view](#the-3d-terrain-view)).
- `wraithguard_toolkit_gui.py` - a drag-and-drop GUI front-end (imports the engine
  directly; it reimplements no logic).
- `mlox_base.txt`, `mlox_user.txt` - mlox rule databases (download/update with
  mlox or `plox`).
- `plugin-order.yml` - MOMW's source of truth for which plugins belong to which
  curated list (optional but recommended). From the
  [modding-openmw.com repo](https://gitlab.com/modding-openmw/modding-openmw.com/-/blob/master/momw/momw/data_seeds/data/plugin-order.yml).
- `theme_template.json` - a commented starting point for making your own GUI
  theme (see [Theming the app](#theming-the-app)).
- `CREDITS.md` - acknowledgements for the projects this tool ports, references,
  and depends on (mlox, plox, tes3conv, modmapper, OpenMW, MOMW, and more).
- `CHANGELOG.md` - what changed between releases (current: **3.1**).
- `REMAINING_WORK.md` - the honest list of what is still outstanding in the
  codebase and against PEP standards, measured rather than recalled.

## Requirements & setup (Windows, Linux, macOS)

Pure Python + tkinter, so it runs on all three platforms.

- **Python 3.10+** (3.11+ gets `tomllib` for free; on 3.10 install `tomli`).
- **tkinter** - bundled with the python.org installers on Windows and macOS. On
  Linux, install it from your package manager, e.g. Debian/Ubuntu:
  `sudo apt install python3-tk`.
- **Optional extras** (the tool degrades gracefully without them):
  - `pip install tkinterdnd2` - drag files into the GUI from your file manager.
    Without it, use the **Browse...** buttons (dragging rows to reorder still
    works regardless).
  - `pip install PyYAML` - faster/robust `plugin-order.yml` parsing. Without it,
    a built-in parser is used automatically.
  - `pip install tomli` - only on Python < 3.11, for reading TOML.
  - `pip install pywebview` - shows the cell map in an in-app window (uses the OS
    webview, so the SVG heatmap and tabs render exactly like a browser).
    `tkinterweb` also works as a lighter fallback; without either, the map opens
    in your default browser.

Install optional deps on an externally-managed Python with
`pip install ... --break-system-packages` if needed.

### Packaging into a standalone `.exe` (PyInstaller / auto-py-to-exe)

The tool runs frozen. It never persists data next to `__file__` (which, when
frozen, is a temp extraction dir that's wiped on exit), so your settings and
outputs survive the build:

- `wraithguard_toolkit_settings.json`, `wraithguard_toolkit_trace.log`, `cell_map.html`,
  and the `tes3conv_json/` spool are written **next to the `.exe`**. If that
  folder isn't writable (e.g. installed under `Program Files`), they fall back to
  a per-user data dir (`%APPDATA%\MloxSubsetSort` on Windows,
  `~/Library/Application Support/MloxSubsetSort` on macOS,
  `~/.config/MloxSubsetSort` on Linux).
- The in-app cell-map viewer re-invokes the same executable with `--show-map`, so
  pywebview works from the frozen build too (no bundled Python interpreter
  needed). **But the library must actually be inside the exe** - if it isn't, the
  map falls back to the browser.

**Bundling the embedded (pywebview) cell-map viewer.** In your build environment,
`pip install pywebview`, then tell PyInstaller / auto-py-to-exe to collect it and
its Windows backend. In auto-py-to-exe, add under *Advanced → hidden-import* and
*--collect-all*, or on the PyInstaller command line:

```
pyinstaller --noconsole --collect-all webview --collect-all clr_loader \
    --hidden-import clr --hidden-import webview.platforms.edgechromium \
    wraithguard_toolkit_gui.py
```

pywebview on Windows uses the Edge **WebView2** runtime (present on Windows 11 and
most updated Windows 10; otherwise install the free "Evergreen" runtime from
Microsoft). To confirm what the build actually sees, run the exe with `--trace`
and open the log: the `viewers: ... pywebview=True/False` line and the
`cell map: viewer = ...` line tell you which path it took.

If you'd rather avoid the WebView2 dependency, bundle **tkinterweb** instead
(`pip install tkinterweb`; `--collect-all tkinterweb`). It renders the SVG map in
a real in-app window (the tab buttons need a full browser, so use *Open in
browser* for those). Without either library, the map opens in your browser.

Run the GUI:

```
python wraithguard_toolkit_gui.py
```

## GUI walkthrough

The left half is the drag-to-reorder panels; the right half is inputs, options,
actions, and a colorized log. Drag the **hamburger grips** on the dividers to
resize any panel.

**Inputs (top right):**

- **openmw.cfg** *(required)* - read the current `content=`/`data=` order from
  here, and (optionally) patch it.
- **customizations.toml** - your `momw-customizations.toml`, to pull the
  plugin/data-path subset from automatically.
- **subset file** - a plain-text list (one plugin filename or data folder path
  per line) or a minimal TOML. A `#` starts a comment only at the start of a line
  or after a space, so a `#` inside a name (e.g. `FMI_#NotAllDunmer.ESP`) is kept.
  Combine with an emit target and it's enough on its own to generate a brand-new
  customizations TOML.
  - **Scan...** - generate this subset by walking a mods folder (see below).
- **emit corrected TOML to** - where to write the sorted/re-anchored
  `momw-customizations.toml`. (Or tick *Write directly back...* to overwrite the
  source in place, with a timestamped `.bak`.)
- **list name** - the MOMW list these customizations apply to (e.g.
  `total-overhaul`). Required by the Configurator; also drives the yml features.
- **plugin-order.yml** - enables the curated-vs-custom features below.
- **Rule files** - mlox `.txt` rule databases in priority order (base first,
  your user rules last).

**Options:**

| Option | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Dry run | Preview only - Export writes nothing (on by default). |
| Write openmw.cfg directly | Patch `content=`/`data=` in place on Export (`.bak` made first). |
| Sort data= paths too | Also position `data=` folder inserts (mlox has no data-path order, so this is opt-in). |
| Skip .bak backup | Don't back up before overwriting. Not recommended. |
| Skip mlox warnings | Skip evaluating `[Conflict]/[Requires]/[Note]`. |
| Create subset text document | Controls **Scan...**: on = write a `.txt`; off = keep the scan in memory for this session only. |

**Actions** sit in two compact rows below the options. Top row: the core loop
(**Sort**, **Export**) plus the record/cell analysis buttons (**Check
Conflicts**, **Cell Map**, **Resource Conflicts**), with the status text
trailing. Bottom row: the plugin tools (**Lint**, **tes3cmd**, **Save Check**,
**Backups**).

1. **Sort** - runs mlox and fills the order panels. Never writes anything; always
   safe. Red rows are your custom additions; **purple** rows have a missing or
   mis-ordered master (see the MASTER CHECK section in the log).
2. **Export** - writes `openmw.cfg` and/or the corrected TOML using whatever
   order the panels currently show. (Uncheck *Dry run* to actually write.) Every
   TOML export runs a **Configurator preview**: the emitted customizations are
   applied to a simulated fresh cfg using a faithful re-implementation of
   momw-configurator's own apply logic, and the result is verified against the
   sorted order - a green `VERIFIED` line means what the Configurator will do is
   exactly what you sorted. Export also warns if `openmw.cfg` changed on disk
   since the Sort (e.g. the Configurator re-ran underneath you).

The **analysis** buttons (Check Conflicts, Cell Map, Resource Conflicts, Lint)
run against the sorted, enabled plugins and never modify anything; the **tools**
row covers tes3cmd (clean / resync / header, VFS-safe), Save Check (verify an
`.omwsave`'s dependencies are still present), and Backups (restore or delete
backups left by this tool, tes3cmd, and the Configurator).

**Resource Conflicts shows meshes in 3D.** Select a conflicting `.nif` and
press **View in 3D**: one viewport with a checkbox per provider, so the camera
never moves as you switch between them - the whole point, since a view that
re-frames itself is comparing two different pictures. A node tree on the left
lists what the render cannot show: collision nodes, controllers, particle
systems, and any block nothing references. Drag to orbit, wheel to zoom, and
**Textures** turns texturing off when you want to compare shape alone.

It opens in the same in-app viewer as the other visualisations (pywebview),
falling back to your browser. It is served from a small local server on `127.0.0.1` - nothing leaves
your machine, the address is not reachable from the network, and every request
carries a one-off token for that session. **Export 3D file...** writes the same
view as a single self-contained HTML file you can keep or send to someone; that
is also what you get automatically if the app cannot open a local port.

**Resource Conflicts reads meshes.** A conflict list can tell you which mod
wins a file; it cannot tell you the winner is a low-poly stand-in with no
collision. So when two mods ship the same `.nif` and the bytes actually differ,
the report says what the winning mesh *costs* you - lost collision, lost
animation, a fraction of the triangles, or textures it references that nobody
ships. Select a row and the panel below reads both meshes then and there and
describes each provider in full.

Nothing is read during the scan except meshes that already conflict **and**
already differ, and results are cached on file contents, so a mesh shipped
identically by four mods is parsed once. A mesh it cannot read - an unfamiliar
NIF version, a truncated download - is reported as unreadable rather than
guessed at, and a partly-read mesh never reports something as *missing*, since
the node may simply be in the part that was not reached.

Every list in the app supports **type-to-jump**: click it and start typing a
name - prefix match first, substring fallback, tap one letter repeatedly to
cycle its matches, Backspace edits, Esc clears. The two sort panels show what
you've typed in their title bar.

### Reordering rows

Drag a row up/down with the mouse, or select it and use **Move Up** / **Move
Down**. Both work with a multi-selection (Ctrl/Cmd-click, Shift-click) - the Move
buttons handle any selection, and dragging moves a contiguous block. This only
overrides where *your* additions land; it's applied at Export time.

### Reading the log

The log color-codes each line so you can scan it quickly:

- **green** - a plugin/path this sort inserted or moved (`<-- inserted`).
- **orange** - a heads-up: an mlox `[Conflict]/[Requires]/[Note]` warning, a
  `plugin-order.yml` note, or a rule *not applied* because your curated cfg order
  already ordered it the other way. Those "not applied" lines are a handy
  diagnostic: if a mod you just added misbehaves, they tell you exactly where
  mlox disagreed with your cfg - you decide whether to nudge it in the panel.
- **blue** - a section header; **red** - an error worth checking.
- **plain** - a frozen base row left untouched.

### Theming the app

The **Theme:** dropdown next to the log panel sets the colors for the *whole
app* - window, buttons, frames, tabs, lists and entries, as well as the log's
own syntax highlighting and the field-diff viewer. Switching re-themes
everything immediately, including windows you already have open, and your
choice is remembered between sessions.

23 themes are built in: Dark (default), Dracula, Monokai, Atom One Dark,
Gruvbox Dark, Monokai Pro, Tokyo Night, Night Owl, Nord, Shades of Purple,
GitHub Dark, Catppuccin Mocha, Ayu Dark, Cobalt2, SynthWave '84, Winter is
Coming, Material Dark, Bluloco Dark, Palenight, Poimandres, Noctis, Panda and
City Lights. (Looking for One Dark Pro? That's the One Dark palette - use
Atom One Dark.) **Import Theme...** adds your own, in either of two formats:

- **Native JSON** - 9 required colors (`background`, `foreground`, `select`,
  `section`, `warn`, `error`, `ok`, `inserted`, `dim`), plus optional
  syntax-token colors and an optional `"chrome"` object if you want to set the
  window colors explicitly. Start from `**theme_template.json`** next to the
  app: it is commented, imports as-is, and reproduces the default palette.
- **base16 schemes** - any `.yaml`/`.yml`/`.json` with `base00`..`base0F`, e.g.
  from the [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) or
  [atelierbram](https://github.com/atelierbram/syntax-highlighting) scheme
  repos. No PyYAML needed; a small built-in parser reads them.

Any window color you don't specify is derived from the theme's `background` -
lightened for dark themes, darkened for light ones - so a plain 9-color theme
or a bare base16 scheme still themes the entire app coherently. Imported themes
are saved to `log_themes.json` and appear in the dropdown from then on.

### Opting rows out (disable / enable)

Not everything you scanned needs to load. In either order panel, select one or
more rows (Ctrl/Cmd-click and Shift-click for multi-select) and click
**Disable / Enable** - or double-click a single row. Disabled rows are dimmed and
marked with `✗`.

- Disabled rows are left out of **Export**: a brand-new custom item is simply not
  inserted; an item that already exists in your `openmw.cfg` is emitted as a
  `removeContent` (plugin) or `removeData` (data path) in the corrected TOML, so
  the Configurator durably removes it on the next rebuild.
- Your opt-out choices are remembered across a re-**Sort** (and across **Reset**),
  so you can disable a few, re-sort, and build with the omissions.

---

## Scanning a mods folder

**Scan...** (next to the subset-file field) folds in the old `mod_scan.py`. It
walks the folder you pick and, for every directory that directly contains a
recognized asset subfolder (`meshes`, `textures`, `scripts`, `sound`, `icons`,
`music`, `fonts`, `bookart`, `splash`, `video`) **or** a plugin
(`.esp/.esm/.omwaddon/.omwscripts`), records that folder as a `data=` path plus
any plugins in it as `content=` entries - then stops descending that branch.

- **Create subset text document** ON → you choose where to save the `.txt`, and
  it's loaded into the subset-file field for reuse.
- OFF → the result is held in memory and fed straight to the sort; nothing is
  written to disk.

---

## plugin-order.yml integration

Point the **plugin-order.yml** field at MOMW's file and set **list name**. The
tool then knows exactly which plugins belong to your curated list versus which
are genuinely your additions, and:

- **Curated-vs-custom split** - plugins on the list are excluded from the sort
  (never reordered - that's the list's job) so only your true custom additions
  are touched and highlighted.
- **Read-only warnings**:
  - `[REDUNDANT]` - a "custom" plugin that's actually already on the list.
  - `[ORPHAN]` - a plugin in your cfg that's neither on the list nor in your
    customizations (e.g. a manually-added or TES3CMD-cleaned file).
  - `[NEEDS CLEANING]` - flagged for TES3CMD in the yml.
  - `[LIST ORDER]` - your base order has drifted from the list's canonical order.

Works with or without PyYAML.

**Keeping it current** - click **Update...** next to the plugin-order.yml field
to download MOMW's latest. The download must parse as plugin-order data with
hundreds of entries before a single byte is written (an error page or moved URL
can never clobber your file), and the old copy is kept as a timestamped `.bak`.

---

## Master check, lint, and watchdogs

Every **Sort** runs a **MASTER CHECK** automatically (read-only): each active
plugin's TES3 header masters are verified against the load order.

- `[MISSING MASTER]` - a required master is absent. Distinguishes "installed but
  not in the load order" (enable it) from "not found in any data folder" (the
  game will refuse to load).
- `[MASTER ORDER]` - a master loads *after* its dependent.
- `[MASTER SIZE]` - the installed master's size differs from what the plugin
  recorded (built against a different version; a recorded size of `0` usually
  means a failed `tes3cmd` sync - the tes3cmd window's in-app resync fixes it).

Plugins with a missing/mis-ordered master are drawn in **purple** in the plugin
panel.

**Lint** (button, or `--lint`) runs tes3lint-style checks over the sorted,
enabled plugins - natively, no perl needed:

- `[EVLGMST]` - the 72 "evil GMSTs", flagged only when name **and** value match
  (a deliberate change is left alone).
- `[FOGBUG]` - an interior cell with fog density 0 (black-void bug).
- `[NO PATHGRID]` - a new interior cell with no pathgrid anywhere in the load
  order (NPCs can't pathfind).
- `[EXP-DEP]` - scripts calling Tribunal/Bloodmoon functions in a plugin that
  doesn't master the expansion.
- `[TWIN]` - an active `.omwaddon`/`.esp` whose `.omwscripts` sibling (or vice
  versa) sits in the same folder but isn't in the load order.
- `[HEADER]` - a custom plugin with a blank author/description.

**Watchdogs** - a `[STALE]` warning fires when a generated artifact
(`delta-merged.omwaddon`, `deleted_groundcover.omwaddon`, `S3LightFixes.esp`) is
older than active plugins, meaning the merge no longer reflects your load order;
re-run the Configurator.

---

## tes3cmd frontend

The **tes3cmd** button opens a front-end for tes3cmd (from the MOMW Tools Pack;
the compiled `tes3cmd.exe` is preferred, the perl script works if perl is on
`PATH`). Because tes3cmd only understands one flat `Data Files` directory, this
tool **stages** each plugin into a private Morrowind-shaped folder with its
masters (hardlinked, cached across runs) so tes3cmd sees the full VFS:

- **clean** - removes junk (dup records, junk cells, evil GMSTs). Plugins whose
  masters can't be found are skipped (cleaning without masters gives wrong
  results). Files are cleaned masters-before-dependents in load order. A
  "MOMW needs-cleaning" button queues exactly the plugins `plugin-order.yml`
  flags. **Morrowind/Tribunal/Bloodmoon are never cleaned** - even a careful
  clean rewrites bytes other content depends on.
- **resync master sizes** - done **in-app**, VFS-aware. tes3cmd's own
  `header --synchronize` writes *empty* sizes on a multi-folder OpenMW setup;
  this resolves each master across all data folders and rewrites only the 8-byte
  size fields (one-time `.masterfix.bak`, verified byte-exact).
- **header** - view author/description/masters (read-only).

### Making mlox rules (rule maker)

The rule base is actively maintained at
[github.com/DanaePlays/mlox-rules](https://github.com/DanaePlays/mlox-rules) -
the same source plox uses and mlox 1.1+ auto-updates from. Two buttons on the
rule-files panel keep you current and let you extend it:

- **Update Rules...** downloads the current `mlox_base.txt`/`mlox_user.txt` over
  the matching files in your list (timestamped `.bak` kept; files with other
  names are never touched).
- **New Rule...** writes your own rule without knowing the syntax. It covers the
  whole vocabulary - `[Order]`, `[NearStart]`, `[NearEnd]`, `[Note]`,
  `[Requires]`, `[Conflict]` and `[Patch]`, the `ALL`/`ANY`/`NOT` expression
  tree, the `[DESC]`/`[SIZE]`/`[VER]` predicates, `(Ref:)` citations, `@Section`
  headings and the `!`/`!!`/`!!!` marks. Grab the selected rows from the plugin
  panel (their order becomes the rule order) or type names, group them into
  `[ANY ...]`, preview, and append.

  Everything is **validated before it can be written**, because mlox discards a
  rule it cannot use *without saying so* - the moment of writing is the only
  chance you get to find out. A **Rule guide** button opens
  [MLOX_RULES.md](MLOX_RULES.md) beside the window.

  Rules go to a personal file that's auto-added **last** in the list so your
  rules win conflicts - `mlox_base.txt`/`mlox_user.txt` are refused as targets
  since "Update Rules..." overwrites them. Consider contributing good rules
  [upstream](https://morrowind-modding.github.io/modding-tools/sorting-plugin-load-order/mlox/mlox-rule-guidelines).
- **Sources...** points both updaters at a fork or mirror if upstream moves. The
  rules field is a URL template containing `{name}`; the plugin-order.yml field
  is a plain URL. Blank = built-in defaults; both persist in settings.

### Save Check and Backups

- **Save Check** - pick an OpenMW `.omwsave` and verify every content file it
  depends on (the save's `DEPE` list) is still in the load order. OpenMW refuses
  to load a save with missing plugins, so this catches it before an export
  orphans a character.
- **Backups** - lists every backup this tool, tes3cmd, and the Configurator
  leave behind (`.preclean.bak`, `.masterfix.bak`, `name~1.esp`, timestamped
  `.bak-*` / `.backup.*`) across the data folders, with restore-over-original
  and delete.
> **Grass mods.** A folder scan takes every plugin it finds, so a shared mods
> folder sweeps grass plugins into the subset along with everything else. Any
> plugin your `openmw.cfg` declares on a `groundcover=` line is held out of
> `content=` automatically (the run tells you which), because loading a grass
> mod as content spawns every blade as a real object. Its `data=` path is still
> written, and the `groundcover=` lines are left alone. Plugins that merely have
> "grass" or "groundcover" in the *name* are not touched - only what your cfg
> actually declares.
>
> For a grass mod you have **just installed**, which nothing declares yet, say so
> once: a `groundcover=Vurt_Grass.esp` line in your subset file, `--groundcover
> Vurt_Grass.esp` on the CLI, or the **Declare as groundcover** field in Options.
> It is then written as `groundcover=` instead of `content=`, in both the cfg and
> the emitted TOML. Name its folder as usual - the `data=` entry is still needed
> for OpenMW to find the file.

- **Help** - opens this Read me or the Quick start as a readable page with a
  contents sidebar, rendered by the app itself. No network, no external viewer,
  and it works from the frozen `.exe` (both documents are bundled into it).

---

## Conflict detection (TES3 records)

Click **Check Conflicts** (after a Sort) - or pass `--check-conflicts` on the CLI
- to scan the active plugins for **record-level conflicts**, the way TES3View /
tes3cmd do: where two or more plugins define or override the *same* record (by
type + editor id), the last one in the load order wins.

- Results appear both as a color-coded report in the log **and** in a dedicated
  **Conflicts window** (sortable table: type, record, how many plugins touch it,
  and the winner). Conflicts that involve **your** custom mods are marked with a
  ★ and listed first - those are the ones your additions caused.
- Double-click a field for the full value per plugin. Where the field can be
  tied to a documented subrecord it is labelled in the file format's own terms
  (`VHGT - Height Data (struct, 4,232 bytes, optional)`), and a **Format
  reference** button shows what the whole record type is supposed to contain:
  every subrecord, whether the game requires it, how wide it is, and the named
  fields inside the struct ones. A diff tells you what changed; that tells you
  what it was.
- Compiled scripts are **disassembled** rather than shown as base64, including
  the 360 MWSE / MW-Enhanced functions - calls to those are marked, because a
  script using one will not run without that runtime installed.
- Save the full list to CSV for later.
- Read-only and opt-in: it never changes the sort or your files, and it needs the
  plugin files reachable via your cfg's `data=` folders. It can be slow on a big
  list (it parses every active plugin), so it runs in the background.

Handles `**.esp/.esm/.omwaddon/.omwgame`** (all TES3-format) and `**.omwscripts`**
(OpenMW's text Lua-attach config). Lua scripts are surfaced as `LuaScript` records
keyed by their script path - whether declared in an `.omwscripts` file or in an
`.omwaddon`'s `LuaScriptsCfg` - so two mods attaching the same script path show up
as a conflict.

**Two engines:**

- **Built-in (default, no dependencies)** - record-level: which plugins touch the
  same record. Handles the common types including scripts (by name), interior
  cells (by name), exterior cells / landscape (by grid coords), and Lua scripts
  (by path, from `.omwscripts` and `.omwaddon`).
- **tes3conv (optional) - adds field-level diffs.** If a
  [`tes3conv`](https://github.com/Greatness7/tes3conv) binary is available, the
  Conflicts window shows a **field-by-field comparison** for the selected record
  (each plugin's value side by side, differing fields in red, last column wins) -
  the same JSON approach TES3 Conflictsolver uses. Point the tool at it via the
  **Set tes3conv...** button, the `--tes3conv` CLI flag, `$MLOX_TES3CONV`, your
  `PATH`, or by dropping the binary next to the script.

Depth is record-level for detection (not a full record schema like xEdit); use it
to spot overlaps worth a patch, and the field diff (with tes3conv) to see exactly
what differs. Confirm anything subtle in TES3View if needed.

### Data-path resource (VFS) conflicts

Click **Resource Conflicts** (or `--resource-conflicts`) to scan your `data=`
folders for **loose-file conflicts**: the same relative path (a mesh, texture,
script, icon…) provided by two or more mod folders. In OpenMW's VFS the **later**
`data=` folder wins, so these are decided by data-path order - reorder the
**Data path order** panel to change the winner (this is what MO2's *Data*
conflicts show). Read-only; a window lists each file, how many folders provide
it, and the winner (yours highlighted), with CSV export. Can be slow on a big
install.

### Skipping noisy mods, settings, JSON

- **Exclude field** (Options) - comma-separated glob patterns to skip in the
  Conflict / Cell-map / Resource scans, e.g. `s3lightfixes*, *delta*, *grass*`.
  Great for "touches-everything" mods that swamp the results. Saved with settings.
- **Settings are remembered** - your paths, rule files, options, tes3conv path,
  and exclude patterns are saved to `wraithguard_toolkit_settings.json` on close and
  reloaded next launch.
- **Dump tes3conv JSON** - in the Conflicts window (tes3conv mode), export the
  per-plugin JSON for every scanned plugin to a folder you pick.
- **Keep tes3conv JSON dump** (Options) - tes3conv conversions are always spooled
  to a `tes3conv_json` folder next to the tool and read one plugin at a time
  (bounded memory, even on 900+ plugins). Within a run the spool is reused, so
  **Check Conflicts followed by Cell Map won't re-run tes3conv** - a plugin is
  only re-converted if it changed (checked by modified-time). This box only
  decides what happens on exit: checked = keep the folder (reused next launch
  too); unchecked = delete it on close. CLI: `--json-dump-dir FOLDER` keeps it.
- **Scan caching (fast repeats).** The first Check Conflicts / Cell Map reads each
  plugin's JSON once and writes two tiny per-plugin sidecars next to it -
  `*.keys.json` (record ids, for conflict detection) and `*.cells.json` (cells
  touched, for the map) - in a single pass, so running both features reads each
  big JSON only once per run. Every scan after that reads those few-KB sidecars
  instead of re-parsing the multi-MB JSON, so **repeat Check Conflicts and Cell
  Map runs are near-instant**. Sidecars are mtime-invalidated per plugin (an
  edited mod rebuilds only its own), live in the same `tes3conv_json` folder, and
  follow the same keep/cleanup rule. The on-click field diff still reads the full
  record on demand, so accuracy is unchanged.
- The **field comparison** shows list fields (e.g. `references`) as a count;
  **double-click a field row** to see the full value per plugin, pretty-printed.
  Your custom mods are flagged with a **★** in the column headers (and shown in
  **orange** in the double-click popout, vs grey for curated-list plugins), so you
  can tell at a glance which side of a conflict is yours. The popout has a
  **Word wrap** toggle for long values.
- **Compiled scripts are disassembled, not shown as base64.** Two script fields
  are decoded in that popout rather than displayed raw:
  - `**bytecode`** - the compiled script (`SCDT`), rendered as named
    instructions with their operands. Without this, *any* script edit looks like
    a total rewrite, because the whole base64 blob changes.
  - `**variables`** - the script's local variable names (`SCVR`), in declaration
    order, so you can see *which* locals a mod added rather than just that the
    blob differs.

  The disassembly is deliberately honest about its limits. Morrowind's compiler
  stores expressions (the `x == 1` in an `if`) as semi-textual data rather than
  opcodes, so no table-driven disassembler can decode a whole script. Anything
  unrecognised is printed verbatim as offset/hex/ASCII and the walker resyncs on
  the next known opcode - it never desyncs and never invents an instruction. A
  `; decoded: N%` header tells you how much of the stream was understood.

  The opcode table is generated from MWEdit's `Functions.dat` (MIT). When the
  record carries its source text, that is used to suppress false positives: an
  opcode value that happens to occur inside expression data is only decoded if
  the script really calls that function.
- The **Cell map** is written to `cell_map.html` and shown in an in-app window if
  `pywebview` (best) or `tkinterweb` is installed, otherwise in your browser; the
  window has **Save HTML** / **Open in browser**.

### Cell map (which mods touch which cells)

Click **Cell Map** (after a Sort) - or pass `--cell-map out.html` - to build a
self-contained HTML page (a port of
[modmapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53069)) with three tabs: an
**exterior-cell SVG heatmap** (uniform squares, colored by how many mods edit
that cell; hover for the mod list, click a cell to jump to its list row)
plus filterable **exterior-** and **interior-cell lists**. Cells your custom mods
touch get a gold outline, so you can see exactly where your additions land and
which areas are conflict hotspots.

Colors are **banded**, not a gradient: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 mods per cell each get
their own color, then 6-10, 11-15, and so on. The differences that matter are
crowded at the bottom of the range - one, two and three mods in a cell are
different situations, while 23 and 24 are not - so the legend beside the map is
its key, with one swatch per band. It writes `cell_map.html` and opens it in an
in-app window (with `pywebview`/`tkinterweb`) or your browser, changes nothing,
and works with either engine (tes3conv gives the most exact cell identification).

### The 3D terrain view

Opened from a landscape record's field diff. It draws the cell's 65x65 height
grid as a surface you can turn, which is the one view that settles "is that a
ridge or a trench" without reading numbers. Drag to rotate, shift/right-drag to
pan, scroll to zoom; **Isometric** and **Top down** are buttons because neither
angle can be hit accurately by dragging.

**Heights are drawn to the same scale as the ground.** A cell is 8,192 world
units across and heights are in world units, so a slope on screen is the slope
in game - a 45-degree hillside renders at 45 degrees. Use **Vertical** to
exaggerate deliberately when a cell is genuinely almost flat; the readout says
so while it is on.

Everything about the shading is a control:

| Control | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Shading** | *Relief* (hillshade with a tint over it) or *Flat facets* (one color per face, which makes the mesh itself visible). The geometry is identical either way. |
| **Hillshade** | The greyscale shading that carries the shape. |
| **Lights** | *Single*, or 3/6-way **multidirectional**: lights spread around the compass, weighted toward the sun azimuth. One light leaves faces in flat black; several fill those shadows without flattening the relief. Overall brightness does not change. |
| **Scales** | *Multiscale* blends slopes measured over three window widths - a narrow window shows texture, a wide one shows landform, and one radius has to choose. |
| **Sun azimuth / altitude** | Where the light comes from, in compass degrees and degrees above the horizon. |
| **Tint** | *Hypsometric* (green valleys to pale summits), *Rainbow*, or *Greyscale*, at any opacity from 0 to 100%. A rainbow resolves small differences far better on nearly flat ground, which is why it is offered - and why it is not the default, since it implies boundaries the terrain does not have. |
| **Contours** | Lines at a round interval chosen to put about a dozen on the cell, with the interval named in the readout. They are dropped where they would crowd close enough to merge, the way a paper map drops them. |

**Reset** restores every control, not just the camera.

## Rule-engine fidelity

Parsing and matching are ported from mlox itself and cross-checked against
`plox`, so several behaviors match the real engine:

- Filename matching handles `*` and `?` wildcards **and** the `<VER>`
  version-number token, with mlox's exact metacharacter escaping.
- `[Order]` chains **bridge over plugins you don't have**: `[Order] A, B, C`
  with `B` not installed still enforces `A` before `C`.
- `[Requires]/[Conflict]/[Note]` warnings understand `ALL/ANY/NOT/DESC` nesting
  and the `[VER]/[SIZE]/[DESC]` functions - reading real plugin version, file
  size, and header description from your `data=` folders, with a conservative
  fallback when those files aren't reachable. `[MWSE-LUA]` is parsed but treated
  as not-applicable under OpenMW.

Beyond mlox's rule DB, the sort also enforces the two hard load-order rules that
rules alone don't cover for arbitrary custom mods:

- **Header-master dependencies + interleaving.** Each custom plugin's TES3 header
  masters are read (from your `data=` folders and the paths added this run), and
  it's placed **after** every master it declares - and *anchored* right after the
  mod it extends (its latest non-vanilla master), so a patch/addon interleaves
  next to its target. Mods that depend only on the vanilla masters have no
  positioning info and sit at the end. Falls back to rules + ESM-first if the mod
  files aren't reachable.
- **ESM-first.** Master-type plugins (`.esm`/`.omwgame`) tie-break before ordinary
  plugins, so a custom master with no rule floats up into the master block.

Both apply only to your customs; the curated list is never reordered.

Deliberately different from full mlox (by design):

- **Sorting only repositions the subset** - the curated (non-custom) `content=`
  order is frozen and never reordered. Custom mods already in the cfg *are*
  repositioned (that's the point); only the curated list is held fixed.
- `[Requires]/[Conflict]/[Note]` are **read-only warnings** - they never change
  the order or block anything. Treat them as a prompt to go check, not gospel.
- `[NearStart]/[NearEnd]` become ordering chains among the listed plugins, not a
  hard push to the file's absolute start/end.
- `data=` inserts are placed by their `after`/`before` anchor (mlox has no
  data-path order); an unfound anchor appends at the end with a warning.

---

## Safety

- Default is preview/dry-run - nothing is written until you say so.
- Timestamped backups are made before overwriting `openmw.cfg` or a
  customizations TOML.
- The curated list order is never modified; only your additions move.
- Customizations aren't supported by the MOMW team - you're responsible for
  making sure your changes don't cause conflicts. This tool helps you *see* and
  *place* them; it doesn't guarantee they're conflict-free.

---

## Developing

Only the standard library is needed to *run* the tool. The checks below need
`ruff`, `black`, `mypy` and `pytest`.

```bash
python -m pytest                # 1,273 tests: no network, no Tk, no real mods needed
                                # (the GUI smoke set skips without Tk; CI runs it under xvfb)
python -m ruff check .          # PEP 8 style, naming, import order, security, perf
python -m black --check .       # formatting
python -m mypy                  # PEP 484 types; gates all 54 shipped files
python tools/check_undefined.py wraithguard_toolkit_gui.py
python tools/check_placeholders.py   # i18n %(key)s placeholders vs their dicts
python tools/make_pot.py --check     # the .pot template must be current
```

All of these are expected to pass with zero findings (CI runs exactly this
list, plus a `python -m build` that exercises the packaging metadata, and
coverage against a `fail_under` floor). A few things worth knowing before
changing anything:

- `**tests/test_differential.py` is the safety net.** It pins 41 observations
  of the engine's behaviour - the sorted order of a real 687-plugin list, rule
  parsing, all 2,964 predicate bodies, the configurator simulation - to hashes
  in `tests/baselines/`. If a refactor changes an answer, it fails loudly
  rather than shipping a different load order. Regenerate deliberately, never
  reflexively:

  ```bash
  python -m pytest tests/test_differential.py --update-baseline
  ```

- `**tests/test_standards.py` checks PEP conformance mechanically** - the
  PEPs that define a standard for this codebase (including PEP 639 licence
  metadata and the one line of PEP 20 that can be checked: `except: pass`
  must say why).

- `**tools/check_undefined.py`** reports every name a module uses but never
  imports. A test run tells you the first one; this tells you all of them.
  It complements the linter rather than replacing it - the two miss different
  things, so run both.

- **Every shipped file meets one standard** - full annotations, PEP 257
  docstrings, no undocumented silent excepts - enforced by ruff and mypy in
  `pyproject.toml` rather than by convention. The only per-file exemptions left
  are genuinely specific ones, each with a stated reason (Tk's per-widget
  `try`/`except`, the engine's section-grouped imports). The last blanket
  exemption - `F401` on the engine, which the re-export shim had made
  unavoidable - was retired with the shim itself in 3.0.

- **The GUI has no automated coverage** (no Tk in the test environment).
  `SMOKE_TEST.md` is a scripted manual pass with log markers, so a broken
  callback shows up as a *missing log line* rather than something you have to
  notice by eye.

`CODE_REVIEW.md` records the defects found so far and - more usefully - the
reasoning behind decisions that look odd, including several linter suggestions
that were deliberately **refused** because following them would have introduced
bugs.
