"""Internationalisation (i18n) and localisation (l10n) support.

Translation uses the standard library's :mod:`gettext`, so catalogues are
ordinary ``.mo`` files under ``locale/<lang>/LC_MESSAGES/<domain>.mo`` and can
be produced with the usual tooling (``xgettext``/``msgfmt``, Poedit, Weblate).

The public entry point is :func:`gettext`, conventionally imported as ``_``::

    from wraithguard import _
    print(_("Sorting plugins"))

Marking a string with ``_()`` does two jobs: it looks up a translation at
run time, and it makes the string discoverable by ``xgettext`` when the
catalogue is regenerated. Until a catalogue exists for the active language
every lookup falls back to the original English text, so wrapping strings is
always safe.

Guidance for translatable strings:
    * Use *named* placeholders (``%(count)d``), never positional ``%s``.
      Translators frequently need to reorder them.
    * Use :func:`ngettext` for anything counted -- plural rules vary widely.
    * Never concatenate sentence fragments; translate whole sentences.
