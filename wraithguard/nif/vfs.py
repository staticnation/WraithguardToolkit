"""Find a mesh the way the game does: loose files first, then archives.

**Most of Morrowind's meshes are not files.** They live inside
``Morrowind.bsa``, and plenty of mods ship theirs the same way. Anything that
reads ``<data folder>/<path>`` and stops when that misses fails on the base
game, which is what the 3D view did::

    Cannot show this mesh
    cannot read /home/.../Data Files/meshes/b/b_n_argonian_m_head_02.nif:
    [Errno 2] No such file or directory

Nothing was wrong with that path. The file simply is not one.

This lives here rather than in the window that needed it because resolving a
game asset is not a user-interface concern, and because a GUI module cannot be
tested without a display -- which is exactly how the gap survived: the texture
side of the same window has always fallen through to the archives, and the
mesh side never did.

Loose files win over archived ones, as they do in OpenMW and in Morrowind.
