"""A self-contained 3D page for looking at one or two meshes.

Answers the question a triangle count cannot: *does the winner actually look
different?* Two meshes side by side, orbitable, is the shortest route from "this
conflict is flagged" to a decision.

**Why three.js is embedded as a classic script.** Modern three.js ships ESM
only, split across ``three.module.min.js`` and ``three.core.min.js``, and **ES
module scripts do not load from ``file://``** -- the origin is ``null`` and the
CORS check fails. These pages are written to disk and opened in a browser, so a
module build cannot work here regardless of how it is packaged. The CommonJS
build is a single self-contained file with no ``require()`` of its own, so it
runs as an ordinary script behind a three-line ``exports`` shim. That was
verified rather than assumed: the shim was exercised and used to build a real
``BufferGeometry`` with computed normals before any of this was written.

**Why the orbit controls are ours.** three.js ships ``OrbitControls.js``, but it
imports the bare specifier ``'three'``, which would drag ESM and an import map
back into a page that has just gone to some trouble to avoid both. Dragging to
rotate is forty lines; an import map that works from ``file://`` is not.

**Why the page is self-contained.** The existing visualisations are single files
a user can move, keep or send to someone. Referencing a sibling script would
break that, and would also behave differently in the in-app viewers
(``pywebview``, ``tkinterweb``) than in a browser. One file behaves the same
everywhere.

**Finding the three.js build itself, and ``ViewerError``, now live in**
:mod:`wraithguard.viz.library`. That code was never specific to a NIF -- it
locates and reads one vendored asset -- and the texture comparison's WebGL
wipe view needs the identical bytes. This module still owns everything that
*is* NIF-specific: the scene payload, the orbit controls, and the page
template below.
