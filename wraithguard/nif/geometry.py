"""Turning a parsed NIF into triangles positioned in world space.

:mod:`wraithguard.nif.reader` reads blocks; it does not assemble them. A mesh
is a *tree*: every shape carries its own transform, every node above it carries
another, and a shape's vertices mean nothing until those are composed down the
chain. A viewer that skipped that would draw every part of a mesh piled on the
origin.

This module does the composition and nothing else. It takes a file parsed with
``geometry=True`` and returns flat triangle soup with world-space coordinates,
which is the form both a renderer and a bounding-box calculation want.

**Roots are found, not assumed.** Block 0 is conventionally the root, and
conventionally is not good enough for files written by twenty years of
exporters. A root here is any node no other node claims as a child, which is
derived from the child links rather than trusted.

    """One drawable shape, in world coordinates.

    Attributes:
        name: The shape's name, as the exporter wrote it.
        vertices: World-space positions.
        triangles: Index triples into :attr:`vertices`.
        uvs: Texture coordinates, one per vertex, empty when the shape has
            none. Only the first UV set is kept: Morrowind draws from it, and
            the rest exist for tools rather than for the game.
        texture: The base texture path, normalised, or ``""`` when untextured.
        glow: The self-illumination texture path, normalised, or ``""`` when
            the shape has none. Distinct from the normal and specular maps a
            viewer finds by filename: this one is a real NIF texture slot,
            the same way ``texture`` is.
        dark: The dark-map texture path, normalised, or ``""`` when the shape
            has none. Multiplied into the base color; the closest built-in
            equivalent a renderer has is an ambient-occlusion map.
        decals: Every decal texture path the shape names, normalised, in slot
            order -- ``decal_0`` first. Empty when it has none.

            A list rather than a single path because the format genuinely
            allows several and vanilla content uses them: ``7decals.NIF`` is
            named for the fact. The reader has always parsed past the first
            (see :func:`~wraithguard.nif.reader._slot_name`); only this layer
            was throwing the rest away.

            Order is load-bearing. Decals composite over one another, so
            slot order is paint order, and reversing it puts the wrong one
            on top.
        detail: The detail-map texture path, normalised, or ``""`` when the
            shape has none. Also multiplied into the base color, at a 2x UV
            tile -- a second multiply alongside ``dark``, not a substitute for
            it.
        gloss: The gloss-map texture path, normalised, or ``""`` when the
            shape has none. A single-channel specular *mask* -- brighter is
            shinier -- and distinct from the specular *map* an OpenMW-style
            ``_spec`` sibling provides, which carries color.
        bump: The bump-slot texture path, normalised, or ``""`` when the shape
            has none. What this means is convention-dependent and this module
            does not decide it: vanilla Morrowind ignores the slot outright,
            while MGE-XE and NifSkope repurpose it to carry tangent-space
            normals. See :func:`~wraithguard.images.roles.classify`.
        vertex_colors: One RGBA tuple per vertex, each channel 0-1, empty when
            the shape has none *or* when the count does not match the vertex
            count. That is the same all-or-nothing rule :attr:`uvs` uses and
            for the same reason: a partial set makes a renderer index past the
            end of an attribute and draw nothing, which is worse than drawing
            it uncoloured.
        diffuse: The material's diffuse color, or ``None`` when the shape has
            no ``NiMaterialProperty``. Multiplies with the base texture.
            ``None`` means *undescribed*, not *black* -- a caller with neither
            texture nor color must fall back to white, or every unmaterialed
            shape renders as a silhouette.
        emissive: The material's emissive color, or ``None`` when there is no
            material property. Combines with :attr:`glow` the way
            :attr:`diffuse` combines with :attr:`texture` -- multiplied -- so
            a renderer that already multiplies an emissive map by an emissive
            color is correct by construction, with no glow-specific case.
        opacity: The material's own alpha, ``1.0`` when there is no material
            property. Independent of :attr:`alpha_blend`: this is *how*
            transparent, blending is *whether the renderer looks at all*.
        alpha_blend: Whether the shape's ``NiAlphaProperty`` enables blending.
            ``False`` when the shape has no such property, which reads
            correctly: nothing describing transparency means opaque.
        alpha_test: Whether that property enables alpha testing -- a cutout,
            not a fade. Independent of :attr:`alpha_blend`; foliage commonly
            sets this and not that.
        alpha_threshold: The cutout reference, normalised to 0-1 from the
            byte the file stores. Only meaningful when :attr:`alpha_test`.
