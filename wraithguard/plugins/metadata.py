"""Locate plugin files and read their metadata.

The ``[VER]``, ``[SIZE]`` and ``[DESC]`` rule predicates test real properties
of real files, so something has to find those files across the several
``data=`` directories OpenMW's virtual file system stitches together. That is
what :class:`PluginFileIndex` does.

The governing principle is mlox's: **never invent a warning that cannot be
substantiated.** The tool is routinely run somewhere the mods are not installed
-- a different machine, a copied config, a packaged build. In that situation
"file not found" means "cannot see the mod folders", not "the plugin is
missing", and reporting the latter would produce confident nonsense. So
lookups return ``None``, :attr:`PluginFileIndex.usable` lets callers tell the
two cases apart, and every predicate falls back to mlox's conservative
behaviour rather than guessing.
