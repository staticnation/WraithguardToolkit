"""A loopback HTTP server for the viewer, and why it is shaped like this.

A page opened from disk cannot fetch anything: its origin is ``null`` and every
CORS check fails. That is why the standalone viewer inlines megabytes of
geometry and a copy of three.js into each file. Serving the same page over
``http://127.0.0.1`` removes the restriction, and with it the reason to embed
anything: the page becomes a few kilobytes, the library is fetched once and
cached by the browser, and geometry is requested per mesh instead of being
decided at generation time.

**Security is by construction, not by validation.** This is a listening socket
on a machine full of the user's files, so the design assumes someone will try
to make it serve something it should not:

* It binds ``127.0.0.1`` only, never ``0.0.0.0``, so nothing off the machine
  can reach it at all.
* It listens on an ephemeral port, chosen by the OS.
* Every request must carry a per-session token. Without it the answer is 404 --
  not 403, which would confirm the path exists.
* **It has no filesystem mapping.** Payloads are registered in memory and
  served by key. There is no code path from a URL to :func:`open`, so path
  traversal is not defended against, it is absent. This is the single most
  important property here and the reason
  :class:`http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler` is not used: that class exists
  to serve a directory, which is exactly what must not happen.
