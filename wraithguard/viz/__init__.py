"""Visual representations of load-order conflicts.

Every renderer here is a **pure function from data to an HTML string**: no Tk,
no file I/O, no network. That is what makes them testable in the hermetic
suite, which matters more than usual because the GUI they are reached from has
no automated coverage at all (``REMAINING_WORK.md`` §4). The GUI's job is
reduced to writing the returned string to a file and opening it.

The pages answer questions the text diff cannot:

* :func:`build_conflict_map` -- *where* in the world your mods collide.
* :func:`build_height_delta` -- *how much* terrain each plugin moved, as a
  chain of edits rather than a star of comparisons against the winner.
* :func:`build_pathgrid_graph` -- *which* navigation edges a mod rewired.
* :func:`build_terrain_3d` -- the cell as a surface, for when a number grid
  still does not convey the shape.

The severity color language (green fine, yellow minor, red major) follows
``merged_lands`` (MIT), which established it for TES3 land conflicts. Matching
a tool people already read beats inventing a nicer palette. That tool *merges*
land; this one sorts and reports, so these pages answer "where do my mods
collide and who wins" rather than "what did the merge do".

**The purity guarantee above is about the four renderers, not the package.**
:mod:`~wraithguard.viz.serve` and :mod:`~wraithguard.viz.library` also live
here, and neither one is pure -- ``serve`` opens a loopback socket, and
``library`` reads a file off disk. They earn their place anyway: both exist
to get a generated page in front of a user, which is the same job
``build_conflict_map`` and its siblings do one step earlier, just for the mesh
viewer and the texture comparison rather than for a page built in this
package. Reached directly (``wraithguard.viz.serve``, ``wraithguard.viz.library``)
rather than through this module, the same way :mod:`wraithguard.nif` leaves
:mod:`~wraithguard.nif.viewer` and :mod:`~wraithguard.nif.textures` off its
own curated export list without those modules being any less real.
