"""Convert between absolute vertex heights and the stored ``VHGT`` encoding.

:mod:`wraithguard.tes3fields.landscape` already decodes ``VHGT`` into absolute
world-unit heights for the diff window. Merging needs the *inverse*: having
combined two mods' terrain, the result has to be written back as an offset plus
a grid of ``int8`` deltas. This module is that direction, plus the vertex
normals that must be recomputed to match any height that moved.

**The encoding, and the trap in it.** ``VHGT`` stores a ``float32`` base height
followed by 65x65 signed byte deltas, all pre-divided by
:data:`~wraithguard.tes3fields.landscape.HEIGHT_SCALE` (8). The deltas are
*doubly* cumulative: each row's first delta accumulates onto a carried row
height, and every later column accumulates along that row. Reversing it means
differencing along both axes in the same order.

**Not every landscape is representable, and that matters.** A delta is one
signed byte, so two adjacent vertices cannot differ by more than 127 stored
units -- 1,016 world units, about eleven feet per vertex step. Real terrain
almost never approaches that, but a *merged* landscape can: splice the bottom
of one mod's canyon against the top of another's plateau and the seam between
them may be steeper than the format can express.

Merged Lands clamps the gradient and then asserts that decoding reproduces the
input, which aborts the whole run on the one cell that cannot round-trip. That
is the right instinct -- silently writing a cliff the user did not ask for is
worse -- but the wrong remedy for a tool someone runs on two hundred plugins.
Here the clamp is reported instead: :func:`encode_vertex_heights` returns the
vertices it could not represent, so the caller can name the cell, skip it, or
fall back to one mod's version, and the other two hundred plugins still merge.
