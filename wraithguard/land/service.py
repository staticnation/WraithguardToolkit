"""One call that turns a load order into a merged landscape plugin.

The GUI and the command-line tool both need the same six steps in the same
order, and neither should own them. This is that sequence behind one function,
with progress reported as text so a Tk log panel and a terminal can show the
same thing without either knowing about the other.

**Everything it does is additive.** Your plugins are never modified. The output
is one new file; deleting it restores the previous behaviour exactly. The only
destructive act available is overwriting a previous ``Merged Lands.esp``, and
that is the caller's decision.

    OpenMW composes its load order from *several* ``data=`` directories, and a

    mod in its own. Looking in only the folder where the first plugin happened
    to be found makes every master installed elsewhere unreadable.

    **The last directory holding the file wins, not the first.** OpenMW
    resolves a name that several ``data=`` folders provide to the one declared
    *latest*: a later ``data=`` line shadows an earlier one, exactly as a later
    plugin overrides an earlier plugin. So a mod split across
    ``.../00 Core`` and ``.../01 Patch`` -- both providing the same
    ``Foo.esp``, with the patch folder second -- must resolve to the patch
    copy. Returning the first match instead reads the pre-patch file: the merge
    then diffs terrain the player never loads, and a ``.mergedlands.toml`` aimed
    at the patch has no effect because the patch was never opened.

    ``directories`` therefore arrives in load order (earliest ``data=`` first),
    and the search keeps the *last* match rather than returning the first.

    The search is case-insensitive because ``openmw.cfg`` and the file system
    routinely disagree: ``RepopulatedMorrowind.ESM`` against
    ``RepopulatedMorrowind.esm``, and a case-sensitive filesystem will not
    match them.

    Merged Lands declares as masters exactly the plugins that contributed --
    every plugin supplying a land texture that survived cleaning, and every
    plugin that edited a cell that was written -- rather than every master in
    the load order. Two reasons, and both matter:

    *It is honest.* A load order with twenty-seven masters does not mean this
    plugin depends on twenty-seven masters. Declaring the ones it read from is
    what the dependency list is for.

    *It is enforcement.* A declared plugin has to be present and has to load
    first. A merged file built from a mod's terrain and then loaded without
    that mod is a file describing edits to land that is no longer there;
    declaring the mod makes the engine refuse rather than render it.

    Note that the ``.esp`` mods appear here as masters. That is not a category
    error -- a TES3 master list is a dependency list, and nothing stops an
    ``.esp`` being on it.
