"""Guarantee that merged terrain is representable in ``VHGT``.

**The constraint.** ``VHGT`` stores heights as signed-byte deltas along each
row, and down column zero. Two adjacent vertices therefore cannot differ by
more than 127 stored units -- 1,016 world units. Real terrain never approaches
this; merged terrain can, because seam repair pulls a shared border to an
agreed height while the vertex beside it stays where its mod put it.

Feathering (:mod:`~wraithguard.land.seams`) removes most of that by spreading
the correction inward. It is a good heuristic and not a guarantee: measured on
two overlapping Solstheim mods it took 125 unencodable vertices down to 6. This
module removes the rest, by construction.

**How.** Walk every constrained pair. Where the step exceeds the limit, move the
two ends toward each other until it fits, and repeat until nothing exceeds. Each
pass strictly reduces the total excess, so it terminates.

**Which end moves: an even split, and curvature weighting measured worse.**

It seemed obvious that the excess should be pushed away from structured terrain
-- protect the lip of a carved cliff, flatten the plateau beside it -- the same
argument :mod:`~wraithguard.land.curvature` makes about which *edit* matters.
Measured on two overlapping Solstheim mods:

=========================== ======= ============== =========
split                       passes  vertices moved clamped
=========================== ======= ============== =========
even                        7       42             0
inverse to local structure  24+      129            0
=========================== ======= ============== =========

Both reach representable terrain. The weighted split needs three times the
passes and touches three times the vertices, because **an asymmetric correction
propagates**: moving one end a long way to spare the other creates a fresh
over-limit step with that vertex's *next* neighbour, which the following pass
has to fix, and so on outward. An even split disturbs both sides equally and
settles.

So the default is an even split. ``use_curvature`` remains available because
the argument for it is sound on a single step in isolation -- it is the
interaction between steps that defeats it -- and a landscape with very sparse,
very steep features may yet behave differently.

**Shared vertices move in lockstep, or not at all.** A cell's boundary vertex
is the same ground as its neighbour's. Moving one without the other would
reopen the seam that repair just closed, so every adjustment to a boundary
vertex is applied to its twin -- up to three of them at a corner -- in the same
pass.

That only works when every cell sharing the vertex is *in the set being
written*. Where one is not -- terrain the merge does not own and will not emit
-- the vertex is **pinned**: moving it would tear the merged landscape against
ground that stays exactly where it is. Measured before this rule existed, the
limiter left 3 such borders disagreeing by up to 1,227 world units, each one a
crack against untouched vanilla.

Pinning can leave a step that cannot be made representable, because the only
vertices able to absorb it are ones we may not move. That is reported rather
than forced: a clamped vertex is a small local error, and a tear against
vanilla is a visible seam across the world.
