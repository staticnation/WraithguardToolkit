r"""Per-plugin merge settings read from ``.mergedlands.toml`` sidecars.

A plugin may ship a file beside it controlling how its landscape edits are
merged::

    Data Files/
        Cantons_on_the_Global_Map_v1.1.esp
        Cantons_on_the_Global_Map_v1.1.mergedlands.toml

Two knobs per layer. ``included = false`` drops that plugin's edits to the
layer entirely; ``conflict_strategy`` decides what happens where its edits
collide with another mod's.

**Why this exists rather than a global switch.** Conflicts are between specific
pairs of mods, and the right answer differs per pair. The documented example:
*Beautiful Cities of Morrowind Suran Expansion* loads after *BCoM* and edits the
same land, and its edits should win -- so it sets every layer to ``Overwrite``.
A global "later wins" would apply that everywhere and throw away merges that
were working.

Example, dropping everything but the world map and forcing that to win::

    version = "0"
    meta_type = "Patch"

    [height_map]
    included = false

    [vertex_colors]
    included = false

    [texture_indices]
    included = false

    [world_map_data]
    conflict_strategy = "Overwrite"

**Defaults are permissive on purpose.** Every layer is ``included = true`` with
``conflict_strategy = "Auto"``, so a plugin with no sidecar behaves exactly as
if this module did not exist. Merged Lands' own advice is not to write one until
it is known to be necessary, and nothing here encourages otherwise.

**One layer name covers two.** ``height_map`` governs vertex normals as well,
because the record stores them under a single flag and a merge that moved a
height without its normal would light the old terrain.

Ported from ``io/meta_schema.rs`` in Merged Lands (MIT, David Von Derau).
