r"""Estimate how much structure a height grid carries at each vertex.

**Why a merger needs this.** :func:`~wraithguard.land.merge.average_delta`
settles a contested vertex by weighting the two edits by magnitude, on the
assumption that the larger edit is the more deliberate one. That assumption
fails in a case that is not rare: a mod which bulk-shifts a whole cell by 500
units will dominate one which carved a precise 60-unit road cut, even though
the cut is the structural, intentional edit and the shift is the blunt one.

Magnitude cannot tell those apart. *Curvature* can. Terrain that a human
deliberately shaped -- a road, a terrace, a building pad, a cliff lip --
introduces local structure; a bulk offset introduces none, because every vertex
moves together and the surface keeps its shape exactly.

**The measure.** Following Zhao, Jiang and Guo (2022), "A Novel Quadratic Error
Metric Mesh Simplification Algorithm for 3D Building Models Based on
'Local-Vertex' Texture Features" (ISPRS Archives XLVIII-3/W2-2022, 109--115,
CC BY 4.0), section 2.3: a vertex's curvature is the mean angle between its own
normal and the normals of the faces around it.

.. math:: c_{v_i} = \frac{\sum_k \alpha(n_{v_i}, n_i)}{k}

The paper uses it to *raise* the cost of collapsing an edge in a
feature-rich region, so simplification eats flat areas first. The quantity is
the same one either way: "how much shape is here". We are not simplifying a
mesh, so the quadratic error metric itself does not apply -- but this term
does, and it is the part that was missing.

**Applied to a regular grid.** The paper works on an irregular triangle mesh
where face areas vary, so it area-weights the vertex normal. A ``LAND`` record
is a regular 65x65 grid: every quad is the same size, so the area weighting is
a constant and cancels. That makes the measure cheaper here than in the paper,
not more expensive.

**What this module deliberately does not do.** It does not decide anything. It
reports a number per vertex, and :mod:`~wraithguard.land.merge` decides what to
do with it. Keeping the measurement separate from the policy means the policy
can change without re-deriving the geometry.
