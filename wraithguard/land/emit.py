"""Build the JSON that ``tes3conv`` turns into a merged landscape plugin.

This is the only part of the toolkit that produces a file the game will load,
so it is written to be inspectable rather than clever.

**We do not serialise TES3 ourselves.** Records are emitted as JSON in
``tes3conv``'s schema and ``tes3conv`` performs the binary encoding. That means
the byte-level format is handled by a tool the community already uses, and our
surface is a data structure a person can read. ``tools/check_plugin_roundtrip.py``
established that the conversion converges on real plugins, which is what makes
this route trustworthy.

**zstd is mandatory here, not optional.** ``tes3``'s deserialiser
(``libs/esp/src/features/serde.rs``) runs every base64 field through
``zstd::decode_all`` *unconditionally* -- there is no magic-number check and no
uncompressed fallback. Plain base64 is rejected with "esp deserialize
decompress error" rather than misread, which is the better failure, but it does
mean a merged plugin cannot be produced without a zstd backend: Python 3.14's
``compression.zstd`` or the ``zstandard`` package. ``pyproject.toml`` lists that
as an extra for *reading* script bytecode; for writing it is a requirement, and
:func:`encode_field` says so plainly when it is missing.

**What goes in the plugin**, following Merged Lands: a header, one ``LTEX``
record per land texture in the shared table, and one ``LAND`` record per merged
cell. ``CELL`` records are optional and off by default. References are never
read, compared or written, so the merged plugin carries terrain and nothing
else -- every object, NPC and script in the load order resolves exactly as
before.

**The masters list is the dangerous part.** A merged plugin must declare the
plugins its terrain came from, with the sizes the engine expects, or the game
resolves nothing correctly. That list is the caller's to supply because only
the caller knows the real load order; :func:`build_header` will not invent one.
