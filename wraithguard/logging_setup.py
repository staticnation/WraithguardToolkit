"""Application logging configuration.

The tool has two output channels with different audiences, and conflating
them is what makes CLI tools unpleasant to use:

* **stdout** -- the report the user asked for (the sorted order, warnings
  about their mods). This stays on :func:`print` in the engine: it is the
  product, not diagnostics, and it is what gets piped or copied into a bug
  report.
* **logging** -- diagnostics *about the run* (which file was opened, why a
  rule was skipped, how long a scan took). Off by default, enabled with
  ``-v``/``-vv``, and always written in full to the trace file when one is
  configured.

Typical wiring::

    from wraithguard import setup_logging, get_logger

    setup_logging(verbosity=args.verbose, log_file=args.trace)
    log = get_logger(__name__)
    log.debug("read %d rule blocks", len(blocks))

Levels used by this project:
    ``DEBUG``    Per-item detail: one line per plugin, per rule, per edge.
    ``INFO``     Milestones: "parsed N rules", "sorted N plugins".
    ``WARNING``  The run continues but the result may not be what was wanted.
    ``ERROR``    An operation the user asked for did not happen.
    ``CRITICAL`` Data integrity is at risk; the run should stop.
