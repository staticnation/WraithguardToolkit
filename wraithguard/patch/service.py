"""One call that turns chosen records into a patch plugin.

The GUI and any future command-line caller need the same four steps in the same
order, and neither should own them: read the source plugins, work out what the
patch must declare, carry the records across with their references remapped,
and write one new file.

**Everything it does is additive.** No source plugin is opened for writing. The
output is one new file that loads last; deleting it restores the previous
behaviour exactly. The only destructive act available is overwriting a previous
patch of the same name, and that is the caller's decision.

**A patch can be built over several sessions.** Pass an earlier build of the
same output file as ``carried`` and its records ride along into the new one,
so today's queue only has to hold today's decisions -- last week's are already
in the file being rewritten. See :func:`wraithguard.patch.records.carry_forward`
for why that needs different handling than an ordinary source plugin.
