"""The decisions queued for a patch, and the rules for changing them.

Queuing a record is a decision, and decisions get revisited: you pick a winner,
look at three more conflicts, then realise the first one should have taken one
field from somewhere else. So the queue has to be editable, and editing it has
rules that are easy to get subtly wrong.

This holds no widgets and imports nothing from the interface. That is
deliberate and was learned the hard way twice in this codebase: logic behind a
``tkinter`` import cannot be tested without a display, and what cannot be
tested is where the bugs live.

**The rules.**

*Re-deciding replaces.* Choosing a winner for a record you already chose, or a
plugin for a field you already picked, overwrites the earlier answer. Keeping
both would put two versions of one record in the patch and leave the patch's
*own* last-wins to decide, so the answer given last might not be the one that
reaches the game.

*Whole or merged, never both.* Same reason. Choosing one drops the other.

*The base is whatever currently wins.* A merge is then a list of departures
from what the load order already does, which is the smallest thing that can be
wrong.
