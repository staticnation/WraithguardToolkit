"""Build one record out of several, field by field.

Carrying a whole record settles a conflict by picking a side. Sometimes neither
side is right: one mod fixed the script, another retextured the mesh, and what
you want is a record that has both. That is what this does, and it is what
TES3Edit and TES3 Conflict Solver call merging down.

**Fields are the ones the diff panel already shows.** ``flatten_dict`` produces
dotted paths for nested dictionaries and keeps *lists whole* -- so
``references`` is one value, not one path per reference. That is a deliberate
inheritance from TES3 Conflict Solver, and it is what makes this tractable: a
choice is always a whole value at a path, never half of one.

**Two things are refused rather than merged.**

*Identity.* ``type``, ``id`` and the grid say which record this is. Taking them
from a different plugin does not merge a record; it silently turns it into a
different one, which the patch would then apply somewhere the user never looked
at.

*A field the chosen plugin does not have.* It is genuinely ambiguous -- it
could mean "delete this field" or "I misread the panel" -- and guessing wrong
writes a record no author ever produced.

**References follow their own source.** If the ``references`` list is taken
from a different plugin than the rest of the record, its ``mast_index`` values
belong to *that* plugin's master list and are remapped against it. Using the
base record's mapping would repoint every object in the cell, which is the same
failure :mod:`wraithguard.patch.records` exists to prevent, arriving by a
different door.
