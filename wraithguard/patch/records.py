"""Copy whole records out of one plugin and into a patch.

**What a record patch is.** TES3 resolves a record by last-wins: whichever
loaded file defines it last is the one the game uses, whole. So to make a
chosen plugin's version of a record win, a patch does not need to describe a
difference -- it carries that record verbatim and loads last. Everything the
patch does not carry still comes from the original mods, untouched. That is the
whole mechanism, and it is why a patch can be small.

**The part that is not simple: ``mast_index``.** Every reference inside a
``Cell`` carries one, and it does not name a file -- it is a position:

* ``0`` means *this plugin*, the file the record is being read from.
* ``k >= 1`` means the ``k``-th entry of **that file's own master list**.

Measured on real plugins: ``Clean Solstheim_Castle_v1.1`` declares three
masters and uses indices 0 to 3, with 11,972 references at 0 -- its own placed
objects. ``Bloodmoon`` declares one master and every one of its 26,473
references sits at 0.

Copying such a record into a patch changes what "this plugin" means and
renumbers every master. Left alone, each reference silently comes to mean a
different file: placed objects point at the wrong things, and nothing reports
it. So references are remapped here rather than trusted, and a record whose
references cannot be remapped is refused rather than written wrong.

Nothing in this module writes a file. It builds the record list;
:mod:`wraithguard.land.emit` turns that into a plugin, because a plugin is a
plugin whatever its records are.

    """Re-emit an earlier build of *this same* patch into a new one.

    This is what makes a patch buildable over several sessions: read back the
    file this call is about to overwrite, and carry its records into the new
    build, so a record queued last week is not lost just because this
    session's queue never mentions it again.

    **Index 0 needs no remapping here, and that is the whole difference from**
    :func:`collect`. A record already lives in the file being rewritten, and
    stays there -- the file's own identity does not change just because it is
    being rebuilt, so a ``mast_index`` of ``0`` still means "this file" on
    both sides of the rewrite. Only indices into the *old* header's own master
    list change, because the new build may declare a different one. Nothing
    here requires the old file's name to appear in ``patch_masters``, and it
    must not: declaring a patch as a master of its own replacement is
    circular, and tes3conv will not write it.

    Args:
        records: The previous build's decoded records, header included.
        patch_masters: The master list the new patch will declare.
        skip: ``(record type, key)`` pairs this session already decided.
            Carrying the old answer forward as well would leave the patch's
            own last-wins to pick between it and the new one -- the same
            reason :class:`~wraithguard.patch.queue.PatchQueue` overwrites
            rather than accumulates when a record is re-decided.

    Returns:
        The old records worth keeping, in their original relative order, with
        references renumbered for the new master list. Order matters for a
        dialogue response: it must still follow the topic that owns it, and
        the previous build already put it there.

    Raises:
        PatchError: If an old record references a master the new build does
            not declare. Rescan with that plugin present, or replace the
            patch instead of appending to it.
