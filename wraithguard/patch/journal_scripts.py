"""Find every script call that sets a journal stage, and link it to the stage it sets.

**What "extend script_tokens() rather than reinventing tokenization" actually
means.** That function is a highlighting lexer: it turns source into
``(kind, text)`` spans so a text widget can colour them, and an identifier
like ``Journal`` comes out as an ordinary ``"text"`` span indistinguishable
from any variable name. There is no call-site boundary to read off directly.
:func:`calls_in_text` adds a second pass over that same token stream, looking
for the shape ``Journal <id>, N`` (or ``SetJournalIndex``) -- where ``<id>`` is
the quest, quoted or not, since MWScript accepts ``Journal "Q" 40`` and
``Journal Q 40`` alike and real mods use both -- a small scanner built on the
existing lexer, not a second one.

**Why this needs the compiled-bytecode fallback path too.** An INFO's result
script (``script_text``) is always source -- Bethesda never gives it a
compiled form of its own, so nothing here is ever missing for a stage. A
*standalone* ``Script`` record is different: it carries both ``text`` and a
precompiled ``bytecode``, and some plugins ship the bytecode with the source
stripped. A call that only exists in a script like that still runs in game;
skipping it because the source is gone would make this tool's picture of a
questline quietly wrong for exactly the mods most worth checking. So a
standalone Script with no source falls back to
:func:`~wraithguard.mwscript.disassembler.disassemble`, the same disassembler
the field-diff viewer already uses for the same reason -- see that module's
own docstring for why it labels what it cannot decode rather than guessing.

**Why override resolution matters here too.** A later plugin can redefine an
entire ``Script`` id, and only the surviving version's calls actually run --
an earlier one's is dead code once overridden, same as any other TES3 record.
:func:`calls_from_stages` gets this for free by reading ``Stage.script_text``,
which :mod:`~wraithguard.patch.journal` already resolved through the same
last-plugin-wins-by-id rule for its own purposes. Standalone scripts have no
equivalent upstream resolver, so :func:`calls_from_scripts` does its own,
smaller version of the same thing.

**Why every call also carries its raw enclosing condition, and not an
evaluated one.** A ``Journal`` call sitting inside ``if ( GetDisposition >=
50 )`` only actually runs when that holds -- reporting the call site alone,
with no hint that it is gated, would call itself a "flowchart" while quietly
lying about which paths are real. :func:`calls_in_text_with_context` tracks
``if``/``elseif``/``else``/``while`` nesting in the same single pass over the
token stream and hands back each call's enclosing condition text verbatim,
outermost first. It does not evaluate that text, resolve variables, or decide
whether two branches are mutually exclusive -- the same restraint
:mod:`~wraithguard.mwscript.disassembler` already applies to bytecode
expressions, and for the same reason: a table-driven scan over arbitrary
third-party mwscript cannot safely claim to know what a condition means, only
where it is. A call read from disassembled bytecode carries no condition text
at all (``conditions=()``) rather than a guess -- reconstructing block
structure from compiled jumps is a different, larger problem than this scan
takes on.

**What :func:`statements_in_text_with_context` is for.** A quest stage's
result script rarely only sets the journal -- the same block that advances a
quest is usually also where an NPC hands over gold, an item, a disposition
change, or starts another script, and that is exactly the kind of thing worth
seeing beside a journal entry: what happens here changes from mod to mod, and
knowing *which plugin* did it is the whole point of a tool like this one. A
curated list of "reward" functions would always miss something, so this does
not keep one. MWScript is one statement per line, which is the boundary this
scans against: every line is read as ``function`` (or ``target->function``)
plus its raw ``arguments``, unless its first token is a control-flow keyword
(``if``/``elseif``/``else``/``endif``/``while``/``endwhile``) or a local
declaration (``float``/``short``/``long``) -- those are structure this module
already reports through condition-tracking, not an effect of their own.
Journal/SetJournalIndex lines are excluded too, since :class:`JournalCall`
already owns those. Nothing here interprets what a function's arguments
*mean* -- no per-function argument schema, no "item: gold_001, count: 100" --
only ``function``/``target`` split out from ``arguments`` for scanning, plus
the verbatim line. That is the same restraint as the condition text: this
scan can say what runs and roughly what it is called with, not what it does.
