"""Resolve a cell's placed objects across a load order (pure, no IO).

Three steps, each a plain function so they can be tested in isolation:

* :func:`reference_transform` -- a reference's ``(translation, rotation, scale)``
  as a :class:`~wraithguard.nif.geometry.Transform` in the mesh frame, so a
  placed object is ``ref_transform.apply(v)`` over the mesh's world vertices.
* :func:`build_model_index` -- the winning mesh for every object id, and which
  ids are actors, taken from the load order's object records (last plugin wins).
* :func:`resolve_cell` -- merge a cell's references across the plugins that touch
  it (a later plugin adds, overrides or deletes references by their originating
  master + index), classify each surviving reference against the model index, and
  return the placements plus a :class:`CellAudit`.

The Morrowind reference rotation convention -- which Euler order and sign turns
``rot`` into a matrix -- is the one thing that needs calibrating against a real
cell; it is isolated in :func:`reference_transform` behind named constants.
