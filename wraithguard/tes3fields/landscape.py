"""Decode the binary ``LAND`` (landscape) fields tes3conv writes as base64.

A landscape record is five fixed-size binary blobs. In the field-diff window
they arrive base64-encoded (and zstd-compressed underneath), so *any* edit --
one vertex nudged by a hand's width -- looks like a total rewrite of an opaque
string. Decoded into row-per-line grids, the diff says which rows changed.

Format sources, both permissively licensed and already credited in
``CREDITS.md``: the UESP `LAND record page
<https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind_Mod:Mod_File_Format/LAND>`_ for the
subrecord layout, and **TES3Tool** (MIT), whose
``TES3Lib/Subrecords/LAND/*.cs`` gives the field order and the
height-reconstruction semantics. Where the documentation left a choice open it
was settled by measurement against real plugins rather than assumption -- see
``CODE_REVIEW.md`` §22.

======  ===========  ============================================
Field   Size         Contents
======  ===========  ============================================
VNML    12,675       65x65 vertex normals, ``int8`` x/y/z
VHGT    4,232        ``float32`` offset + 65x65 ``int8`` deltas + 3 unused
WNAM    81           9x9 ``int8`` low-res heightmap for the world map
VCLR    12,675       65x65 vertex colors, ``uint8`` RGB
VTEX    512          16x16 ``uint16`` LTEX indices
======  ===========  ============================================

The detail that is easy to get wrong: **heights are doubly cumulative, not a
running total.** Each row's first delta accumulates onto a carried row height;
the rest of that row accumulates from there. Flat-summing all 4,225 deltas
produces a plausible-looking surface that is completely wrong.

    ``(y1 * 4 + y2, x1 * 4 + x2)`` for the four base-4 digits of ``k``.

    That ordering was confirmed empirically rather than taken on trust:
    de-swizzling raises the fraction of equal orthogonally-adjacent cells from
    **0.714 to 0.852** across **2,190 non-uniform landscape cells** from real
    plugins, and wins in **97%** of them individually. Real terrain has large
    contiguous texture regions, so the more spatially coherent reading is the
    correct one by a wide margin.

    One assumption remains, and it is cheap to check: this presumes tes3conv
    writes the subrecord payload through unchanged, as a lossless converter
    would. If a decoded grid ever looks scrambled in a repeating 4x4 pattern,
