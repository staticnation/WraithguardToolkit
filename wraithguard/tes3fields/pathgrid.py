"""Decode the ``PGRD`` (path grid) ``connections`` field.

``PGRC`` is a flat ``uint32`` array and is meaningless on its own: it is a
*concatenation* of each point's neighbour list, with no delimiters. The slicing
lives in ``PGRP`` -- every point carries the number of connections that belong
to it. Read alone, the field is a wall of integers; read together with the
points, it is a readable adjacency list, and a diff shows which node's edges a
mod actually rewired.

This mirrors how a script's ``bytecode`` is disassembled using the record's
``text``: the neighbouring field is what makes the blob mean something.

Format sources, both permissively licensed: the UESP `PGRD record page
<https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind_Mod:Mod_File_Format/PGRD>`_ and
**TES3Tool** (MIT). The slicing model was confirmed against real plugins: the
sum of every point's connection count equals the edge count exactly
(``CODE_REVIEW.md`` §22).

    **tes3conv prefixes this field with a ``uint32`` count**, the same wrapping
    it puts on ``variables`` (see
    :func:`~wraithguard.mwscript.tes3conv.decode_variables_field`, which strips
    the same four bytes). The raw subrecord inside a plugin has no such prefix,
    so both shapes reach this function and it detects rather than assumes.

    Measured across 717 path grids in 120 cached tes3conv dumps: **100%** carry
    the prefix. The landscape fields in the same dumps carry none -- all 290
    records decode to exactly their documented sizes -- so this is specific to
    the length-prefixed fields, not a blanket property of tes3conv output.

    Leaving the prefix in place is not a cosmetic error: it shifts every
    subsequent edge by one slot, so each point is attributed its neighbour's
    connections. On the record this was found with, it also made the first
    "edge" the value 224 in a grid of 62 points -- an index that cannot exist.

    Args:
        value: The ``connections`` field as tes3conv wrote it.
        expected_edges: The sum of every point's connection count, when known.
            Used to confirm the prefix rather than infer it from shape alone.

    Returns:

        Slicing them into per-point neighbour lists needs the points -- see
        :func:`render_connections`.
