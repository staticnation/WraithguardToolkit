"""Render a DIAL/INFO record as readable dialogue instead of raw subrecords.

An INFO record on its own is opaque: a pile of one- and two-letter subrecords
(ONAM/RNAM/CNAM speaker filters, a packed DATA struct, a list of SCVR function
conditions each paired with an INTV/FLTV number) plus the response text and a
result script. Shown in a diff that way, a dialogue conflict is unreadable --
you cannot tell *which line an NPC says, to whom, and under what conditions*
two mods disagree about.

This module turns one tes3conv-JSON INFO record into that human sentence:

    Fargoth  (Background)
    - If disposition is at least 50
    - If Player Axe Skill >= 1
    Response: "Hello, friend. Have you seen my ring?"

It reads the shape tes3conv (the ``tes3`` Rust crate) emits: a record tagged
``"DialogueInfo"`` whose speaker filters are named fields (``speaker_id`` ...),
whose ``data`` block is already unpacked, and whose ``filters`` list carries
serde enum *names* (``filter_type="Function"``, ``function="PcAxe"``,
``comparison="GreaterEqual"``) with an adjacently-tagged value
(``{"type": "Integer", "data": 1}``). Nothing here parses bytes; it consumes
the JSON the rest of the tool already has.

The condition phrasing -- the mapping from a filter's type/function/comparison
to an English "If ..." line, including the boolean special cases ("If NPC is
not dead", "If player is a member of faction X") and the result-script token
lexer (:func:`script_tokens`) -- is adapted from **Morrowind Dialog Explorer**
(MIT, Sophie Kirschner); see ``src/info_string.py`` and ``src/syntax_highlight.py``
in that project, and CREDITS.md. It is retargeted here from MWDE's raw-subrecord
model onto the tes3conv enum names. Function labels themselves follow the tes3
crate's own ``FilterFunction`` names (prettified), not MWDE's, so they stay in
step with the JSON the tool actually reads.
