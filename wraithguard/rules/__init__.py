"""mlox rule handling: pattern matching, parsing, and predicate evaluation.

This package is being populated incrementally from the engine module. Each
piece is moved with its behaviour pinned by ``tests/test_differential.py``, so
a move that changes an answer fails loudly rather than shipping a different
load order.

This package is the one place these names live. The engine module used to
re-export them so ``core.mlox_pattern_to_regex`` also resolved; that shim was
removed in 3.0 and every caller -- engine, GUI and tests -- now imports from
here (``CODE_REVIEW.md`` §23).
