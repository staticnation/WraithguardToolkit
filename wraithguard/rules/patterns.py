"""Translate mlox filename patterns into regular expressions.

Every ordering and predicate rule in the mlox databases names its plugins by
pattern rather than by exact filename, so this translation sits underneath all
rule matching. It follows mlox's own ``_filename_to_regex`` exactly, because
diverging by even one metacharacter would silently change which rules apply to
which plugins -- the kind of bug that produces a subtly wrong load order rather
than an error.

The rules mlox uses, and therefore the rules here:

* Only ``(``, ``)``, ``+`` and ``.`` are escaped. Everything else is passed
  through, including characters a general-purpose escaper would quote.
* ``*`` becomes ``.*`` and ``?`` becomes ``.?`` -- note ``.?``, not ``.``, so a
  ``?`` also matches the empty string.
* ``<VER>`` (in any casing) expands to a version-number sub-pattern.
* Matching is anchored at both ends and case-insensitive, since OpenMW's
  virtual file system treats plugin names case-insensitively.
