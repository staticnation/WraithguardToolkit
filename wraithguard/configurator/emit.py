    The second thing worth saying is a real limitation. momw-configurator's

            than an ``insert``. They are emitted via the replace passthrough,
            so an insert block here would duplicate and conflict with it.

            so mlox moving one of these cannot be expressed as a replace at

        user_data_values: Raw paths of every ``data=`` insert from this run,
            *before* duplicate-skipping. Required for correctness: a path the
            Configurator already baked into ``openmw.cfg`` on a previous run is
            correctly skipped as a live-cfg duplicate, but must still be
            re-emitted here. Without it the regenerated TOML would silently

            since the cfg was built from this very file -- leaving the
            Configurator nothing to re-insert on the next rebuild.
        list_name: Overrides ``listName``. momw-configurator requires it;
            precedence is this argument, then the source TOML, then

        custom_anchors: Per-plugin anchor overrides.
        new_groundcover: Plugins this run declares as grass that the cfg does not
            already have. Emitted as ``append`` entries (``groundcover=NAME``),
            which is how the Configurator writes a groundcover line -- there is
            no insert form for one. Their **data paths are not handled here**:
            those go through the ordinary data-insert path, because OpenMW has
            to be able to find the file and a data= entry is not grass-specific.
