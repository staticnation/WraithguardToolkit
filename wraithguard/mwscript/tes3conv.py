"""Decode the ``bytecode`` field as tes3conv writes it into JSON.

tes3conv stores a script's compiled ``SCDT`` base64-encoded, and (in recent
versions) zstd-compressed underneath that. Zstd only entered the standard
library in Python 3.14, so decoding is attempted through whichever backend is
present and degrades to a clear message when none is.

The alternative -- reading ``SCDT`` straight out of the plugin -- needs no
compression support at all and is implemented in
:mod:`~wraithguard.mwscript.script_record`. Prefer it when the plugin file is
to hand; this module exists for the conflict view, which has only the JSON.
