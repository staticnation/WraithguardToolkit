"""Download rule files and the MOMW plugin order.

Every URL here is user-configurable -- read from a persisted settings file and
overridable by environment variable -- which makes them untrusted input rather
than constants. :func:`fetch_url_bytes` is the single choke point that enforces
that:

* **Scheme allow-list.** Only ``http`` and ``https``. Without this a settings
  file could point at ``file:///etc/passwd`` and the "update rules" button
  would happily read arbitrary local files over the user's own rule database.
  ``file:``, ``data:``, ``ftp:`` and friends are refused by name.
* **A host is required.** ``https://`` with nothing after it is rejected
  rather than passed to ``urlopen``.
* **A size cap.** Responses are read to :data:`MAX_DOWNLOAD_BYTES` + 1 and
  rejected if they exceed it, so a hostile or broken endpoint cannot exhaust
  memory.

The rejection paths are pure -- nothing is fetched when a URL is refused --
and ``tests/test_differential.py`` pins them against a list of hostile URLs,
so a refactor that let one through fails the suite rather than shipping.
