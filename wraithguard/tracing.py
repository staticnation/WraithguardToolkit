"""Lightweight trace logs for post-mortem debugging.

Distinct from :mod:`wraithguard.logging_setup`, which handles the user-facing
levelled logging. This is a crash-survival tool: timestamped lines appended to
a file and flushed immediately, so that when a heavy operation runs out of
memory or hangs and the process dies, the last steps it managed are still on
disk. That is the whole design constraint -- buffering would defeat it.

Two files, deliberately:

* the **main trace**, covering cell-map and tes3conv work;
* the **sort trace**, a separate file truncated at the start of each sort.

The sort engine's play-by-play runs to thousands of lines and has nothing to do
with the other operations. Interleaving them makes both unreadable, so the sort
gets its own file and each sort starts clean -- a sort log stays small,
self-contained, and worth actually reading.

Tracing is off unless :func:`set_trace_file` is called.
