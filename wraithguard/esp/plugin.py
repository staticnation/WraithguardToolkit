"""Read a whole plugin into records, and write records back to a plugin.

A plugin file is nothing more than its records, one after another, to the end of
the file -- there is no table of contents and no trailing index. So reading one
is a loop over :func:`~wraithguard.esp.record.read_record` until the bytes run
out, and writing one is a loop over
:func:`~wraithguard.esp.record.write_record`. The first record is always the
``TES3`` header (its masters and record count); the rest are the content.

Records whose tag has no class yet come back as
:class:`~wraithguard.esp.record.UnknownRecord` and are written unchanged, so a
plugin that mixes ported and not-yet-ported records still round-trips exactly.

    Every plugin opens with its ``TES3`` header (format version, author,
    description, and master list), and it is the one record a caller often wants
    on its own: the description for an ``[VER]``/``[DESC]`` rule, the masters for
    a dependency check. Reading it does not require reading the file: only the
    first record is parsed, so ``data`` need only contain that record's bytes,
    and -- because the rest of the file is never touched -- a plugin whose later
    records ``tes3conv`` would refuse (OpenMW's ``LUAL``, say) still yields its
    header here.

        data: The plugin's bytes, or at least a prefix holding the whole first
