"""The record framing that sits above the byte layer, and the record registry.

A plugin is a flat sequence of records; a record is a sixteen-byte header then a
body of subrecords. The header is four fields: the four-byte record ``tag``, a
``u32`` giving the body's size, a ``u32`` the format leaves as padding (always
written zero, as the crate does), and the record's :class:`ObjectFlags` as a
``u32``. The body that the size measures is the subrecords -- the flags word,
though it sits in the header slot, is written by the record itself, so the size
is exactly the subrecords and nothing else.

:func:`read_record` reads one header, hands the record a reader *bounded* to its
body so its subrecord loop stops at the record's end, and dispatches on the tag
to the class that knows that record. :func:`write_record` writes the header with
a placeholder size, lets the record write its subrecords, then fills the size in
now that it is known.

A tag with no class yet is not an error and not a loss: it becomes an
:class:`UnknownRecord` holding its bytes verbatim, so a plugin round-trips
whole while records are still being ported one at a time. This is the same
resilience :mod:`wraithguard.land.native` relies on -- a file is never refused
over a record it does not model.
