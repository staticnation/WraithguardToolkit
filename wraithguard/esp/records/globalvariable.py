"""The ``GLOB`` record -- a global variable. A port of ``types/globalvariable.rs``.

A named global the scripting engine reads and writes. Its type -- float, long or
short -- is one byte in ``FNAM``; its value is *always* stored as an ``f32`` in a
following ``FLTV``, and interpreted through the type. So a ``long`` global holds
its integer as that integer's float form, and this mirrors the crate's handling:
a value read for a long or short is truncated to that integer type (the engine
does the same), and a ``NaN`` reads as zero -- as it must, since ``Morrowind.esm``
itself ships one (``ratskilled``).
