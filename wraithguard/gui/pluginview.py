"""The load order as a tree: plugin, kind of thing, thing.

**Why this and not the flat list.** The conflict list answers "what conflicts",
which is the right question exactly once -- when you want a count. Every
question after that is about a *mod*: what does this one change, where does it
lose, is it worth moving or patching. A flat list of 51,946 rows cannot be read
that way, and no amount of filtering turns a list of records into a picture of
a load order.

So this is the same data with the load order's own shape restored: file ->
record type -> record, with the record compared across every plugin that
defines it on the right. That is the layout xEdit established and yampt's
editor follows, and it is worth following because it matches how people
already think about their mods.

**Nothing is built or read until it is opened.** A single mod can edit tens of
thousands of cells, and Tk builds every row eagerly; inserting them up front
freezes the window. So a plugin's groups appear when the plugin is opened, its
records appear when the group is opened, and even then they are inserted in
batches with the event loop given a turn between them -- the tree stays usable
while a large group fills in behind it.

The judgement works the same way. Colouring a record means reading it with
tes3conv, which is far too slow to do for a whole load order up front, but
perfectly fast for the few hundred records you just expanded. So each group
judges itself in the background as it opens, and its rows take their colour as
the answers arrive.

**Colour carries two independent facts**, as it does everywhere in this
package: the text colour says what *this plugin* is doing to the record, and
the row's shade says whether anything is being lost overall. A plugin row takes
the worst of everything beneath it, so a branch worth opening looks like one
without being opened.

The tree structure follows ``model/nav_tree_model.hpp`` in yampt (MIT,
Rafał Wierzchoś): ``file_node_t`` -> ``type_group_t`` -> records, with the roll-up
taking the worst of each child on both axes.

LOG: Final = get_logger(__name__)

#: How many record rows are inserted before the event loop is given a turn.
#: Tk builds rows eagerly, so a group of 30,000 inserted in one go locks the
#: window; in batches it fills in visibly and stays usable throughout.
INSERT_BATCH: Final = 200

#: How many records one opened group will judge in the background. Since each
#: plugin is now read once for the whole group rather than once per record,
#: this is a memory guard rather than a time one -- the values being compared
#: are held while the group is judged. Everything is still *listed*; only the
#: colouring stops here.
JUDGE_BUDGET: Final = 20000

#: How many plugin rows the index scan colours per event-loop tick. The work is
#: dict lookups over a compact index -- no I/O, no records held -- so this is a
#: UI-smoothness knob, not a memory one: a big load order colours over a second
#: or two of ticks rather than one blocking pass.
COLOUR_BATCH: Final = 64

#: Row-background tag marking the plugins that conflict with the selected one.
#: A *background* rather than a foreground, so it stacks with the verdict colours
#: (which are foregrounds) instead of replacing them: "related to what you
#: clicked" sits behind "what each plugin is doing".
CONFLICT_TAG: Final = "conflicts-with-selection"

#: The colour that background-marks them. **Purple, not blue** -- ktim816 asked
#: for blue, but the selection highlight is already blue (``#094771``), so a blue
#: mark would be near-indistinguishable from the selected row. Purple is a hue no
#: verdict foreground uses and clearly not the selection, and it is dark enough
#: that every verdict colour still reads on top of it: the mid-tone red (a losing
#: plugin) and the dim grey (an ignored one) both clear 4:1, the rest 6-7:1.
CONFLICT_BG: Final = "#512e5a"

#: Separator inside a tree row's id. ``\x00`` would also be guaranteed not to
#: occur in a plugin name, record type, or record id, but Tk's item ids are
#: null-terminated C strings under the hood: an embedded NUL silently
#: truncates the id there rather than raising, so a plugin's own row and its
#: first child both end up addressed as just the plugin name and the second
#: insert raises "Item {plugin} already exists". Confirmed against this
#: environment's Tcl 8.6.14. Unit Separator has no such special meaning to
#: Tcl, is just as impossible to find in real TES3 data, and round-trips
#: cleanly through Treeview.insert/exists/get_children.
SEP: Final = "\x1f"

#: Marks a node whose children have not been built yet.
