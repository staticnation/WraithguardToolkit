"""Every quest's journal stages, resolved and shown in order -- with what sets each one.

**Why this is not another `PluginViewMixin`.** That window's whole design is
built around one fact its own docstring states outright: judging a record
means reading it with tes3conv, "far too slow to do for a whole load order up
front" -- hence the lazy expansion, the background judging per opened group,
the batched inserts. None of that applies here. Resolving every quest and
scanning every script is a dict-and-sort and a token-stream scan over records
already in hand; it is the *reading* of those records that costs anything, and
that cost is paid exactly once, for the whole load order, when the window
opens -- not per group, not per click. So this window reads everything in one
background pass and fills the tree once, rather than building pluginview's
incremental machinery for a workload that does not have pluginview's shape.

**What the tree shows beyond the stage list.** Under each stage, a call site
that sets it (Stage 2) appears as a child row -- a standalone Script, another
stage's own result script, *or an ordinary NPC dialogue response*, whichever
plugin's surviving definition supplied it. That last source is not a minor
addition: most real quest progression happens through a regular topic
response whose result script happens to set the journal, not through the
journal-type topic's own entry, which is frequently empty. Missing it would
mean "Set by" was usually wrong about the one thing it exists to answer.
Selecting a stage or a call row shows its raw enclosing condition (Stage 3) in
the detail pane, verbatim source, never evaluated -- the same restraint the
disassembler already applies to compiled expressions, for the same reason: a
heuristic scan over arbitrary third-party mwscript cannot safely claim to know
what a condition means, only where it is. A stage's detail, and each of its
triggers', pulls in dialogue requirements (who has to be speaking, what
disposition or rank or filter has to hold) via the same ``condition_lines``
the field-diff viewer's own INFO rendering already uses -- the "Actor: ...
- If ..." lines its "Read as dialogue..." popup shows -- plus every other
notable thing that trigger's script does: item grants, disposition changes,
another script starting, whatever a mod actually does at that moment,
generically captured rather than matched against a curated list that would
always miss something. A "Set by"/"Also sets"/"Target stage" row that
resolves to a real stage is a questline link and can be double-clicked to
jump the tree there, including across quests.

**Why the detail pane is not a Treeview.** A ``ttk.Treeview`` cell is single
line, always -- there is no configuration that wraps long text inside one, so
a quest's full response text or a raw result script either gets truncated or
forces horizontal scrolling, both worse than actually wrapping it. The detail
pane is a plain scrollable frame of label pairs instead: a field name above,
its value below at ``wraplength``, keeping every field inspectable at
whatever width the pane actually has rather than a fixed column guess.

**What is reused.** The dark theme and reading plugins off the main thread via
``_schedule_ui`` are the same conventions the rest of the GUI already
follows -- there was no reason to invent different ones for this window
specifically.
