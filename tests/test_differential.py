"""Behaviour-neutrality guard for the module split.

The engine is being broken up into packages (``rules/``, ``sort/``,
``configurator/``, ...). Every one of those moves is *supposed* to be purely
mechanical, but "supposed to be" is exactly the assumption that quietly breaks
a working tool. These tests pin the engine's observable behaviour on real
inputs to a stored baseline, so a refactor that changes an answer fails loudly
instead of silently shipping a different load order.

The baseline is a set of hashes committed under ``tests/baselines/``. It is
regenerated deliberately, never automatically::

    python -m pytest tests/test_differential.py --update-baseline

Regenerating is legitimate when behaviour was *meant* to change -- a bug fix
alters output on purpose. The point is that it takes a decision, and the diff
in the baseline file shows exactly what moved.
