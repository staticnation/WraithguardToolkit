"""Tests for every texture decoder and the PNG encoder.

These decoders were checked against an independent implementation during
development, and that check is kept as ``tools/check_images.py`` and
``tools/check_bc7.py`` rather than living here: Pillow is not a dependency of
this project and the texture corpus is not in the repository. At the time of
writing BC7 agreed with Pillow on 19,380 random blocks covering all eight modes
and all 64 partitions, and every other block format agreed on 512 random blocks
each.

What is pinned *here* is different in kind: hand-built inputs whose correct
output can be worked out on paper, and the refusals that turn a broken mod file
into a finding rather than a traceback. A cross-check proves the decoders match
someone else's; these prove they do what this project needs and keep doing it.
