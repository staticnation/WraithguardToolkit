"""Merging one record down out of several, field by field.

Carrying a whole record settles a conflict by picking a side. Sometimes neither
side is right -- one mod fixed the script, another retextured the mesh -- and
what you want is a record with both. That is merging down, as TES3Edit and
TES3 Conflict Solver do it.

The trap is the same one whole-record patching has, arriving by a different
door. ``mast_index`` is a position in *a particular plugin's* master list, so a
``references`` list taken from one plugin while the rest of the record comes
from another must be renumbered against **its own** plugin. Using the base
record's mapping repoints every object in the cell at a different file.
