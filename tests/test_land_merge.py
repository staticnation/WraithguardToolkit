"""Tests for :mod:`wraithguard.land.merge`.

Two properties carry the weight. First, that a vertex only one plugin moved
survives *exactly* -- that is the entire gain merging offers, and an averaging
bug that quietly pulled it toward the reference would erase it while every
count still looked right. Second, that averaging is refused on texture indices,
where a plausible number means an unrelated texture.
