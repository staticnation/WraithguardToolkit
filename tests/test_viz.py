"""Tests for the conflict visualisations.

Fixtures are synthetic, deliberately, for the same reason
``tests/test_tes3fields.py`` uses synthetic ones: the expected answer is exact
by construction, and no third-party mod data is committed to this repository.

The emphasis here is on the things a screenshot would not catch -- that the
severity ramp is monotonic, that a length-prefixed path grid is not
mis-attributed, that untrusted plugin names cannot inject markup, and that the
pages stay self-contained.
