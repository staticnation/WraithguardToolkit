"""Tests for :mod:`wraithguard.land.textures` and :mod:`wraithguard.land.landmass`.

The sharpest test here is the texture one. Three real mods in this repository's
sample all number their first texture ``0`` and mean three unrelated things by
it, so a merge that compares raw ``VTEX`` values repaints terrain while looking
entirely successful. These tests reproduce that collision deliberately.
