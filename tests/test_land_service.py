"""Tests for turning a load order into plugin records.

The failure these pin shipped: a real 27-master load order stopped at
``could not read master distant_seafloor_2.00.esm``, with no way to tell
whether the file was missing, unreadable, or simply somewhere else. Both
halves of that -- searching one folder, and discarding the reason -- are
covered here.
