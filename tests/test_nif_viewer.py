"""Tests for the generated 3D viewer page.

The page's *behaviour* was verified by executing it: both script blocks were
pulled out of a generated document and run under a stub DOM in node, which
built 4 real ``BufferGeometry`` objects with computed normals, framed the
camera at 3x the object radius and issued one render per pane. That cannot live
here -- node is not a dependency and there is no browser in the test
environment -- so these tests pin down the properties that can be checked from
the text: that the page is self-contained, that the geometry really is in it,
and that the escaping holds against names written by strangers.
