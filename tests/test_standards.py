"""Verify conformance to the PEPs that define standards for this codebase.

There are 700+ PEPs. Most are informational (PEP 20's Zen), process documents
(PEP 1), rejected proposals, or *optional* language features -- using
``match`` where ``if``/``elif`` reads better would make the code worse, not
more compliant. So "apply every PEP" is not a checkable claim.

What *is* checkable is the finite set of PEPs that define a standard this
project should conform to. Each is asserted here, mechanically, so the claim
survives future edits instead of resting on a report someone wrote once:
