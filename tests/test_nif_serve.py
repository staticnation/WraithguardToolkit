"""Tests for the loopback viewer server.

Most of these are about what the server *refuses*. It is a listening socket on
a machine full of the user's files, so the interesting assertions are that it
cannot be talked into serving anything nobody registered -- and in particular
that there is no path from a URL to the filesystem at all, which is a stronger
property than "traversal is blocked".
