"""The mesh view has to read meshes that are not files.

Reported by a user on Linux, opening the 3D view on a vanilla mesh::

    Cannot show this mesh
    cannot read /home/.../Data Files/meshes/b/b_n_argonian_m_head_02.nif:
    [Errno 2] No such file or directory

Nothing was wrong with the path. **Most of Morrowind's meshes are not loose
files** -- they live inside ``Morrowind.bsa``, and plenty of mods ship theirs
the same way. The view read ``<folder>/<path>`` and gave up when that missed.

The tell was that the *texture* comparison in the same window worked perfectly:
``TextureResolver`` has always fallen through to the archives. Only the mesh
side went straight to the filesystem.
