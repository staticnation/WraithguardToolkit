"""Reading landscape without tes3conv's permission.

tes3conv decodes a plugin by *understanding* every record in it and refuses the
whole file on one it does not know. A real 27-master load order stopped at::

    could not read master the_Arcane_Academy_of_Venarius.esm:

``LUAL`` is OpenMW's Lua-script configuration record. It has no bearing on
terrain whatsoever, and it stopped a nine-hundred-mod merge before it started.

These tests cover the two things that fix it: a length-driven reader that skips
record types it has never heard of, and the record-key sidecars that say which
plugins are worth opening at all.
