"""Tests for user-rule authoring (``append_user_rule`` and its cycle guard).

``append_user_rule`` now delegates to ``append_authored_rule``, so one validator
and one renderer serve both. These tests kept their value through that change --
and earned it: they caught the new validator accepting ``semi;colon.esp`` and
``brackets[x].esp``, names mlox would read as a comment and as expression
syntax. The wording of two messages and the comment prefix moved with the
implementation, which is what the small edits here record.

Per the mlox rule guidelines, a rule that would cause a cycle is *discarded*
at sort time -- so the authoring side's job is to refuse malformed rules
outright and warn about ones that would be silently dropped.
