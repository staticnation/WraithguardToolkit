"""Headless smoke tests for the Tk GUI.

The GUI has no other automated coverage: it cannot be imported without Tk, so
it is excluded from the hermetic suite and from mypy, and its verification has
been the manual ``SMOKE_TEST.md`` run. That gap is not theoretical -- the last
two defects to reach a user were both here, and both invisible to ruff, mypy and
1,200 passing tests:

* a window that opened **blank**, because a mistyped palette key raised after
  the ``Toplevel`` was created and before its content was packed;
* two panels **gridded on top of each other**, because a body moved during a
  refactor kept row offsets that were relative to a different base.

Neither needs a human to spot. What they need is a display, so this module
builds the real application on a real (virtual) X server and asserts the things
a person would otherwise have to look for.

It **skips** rather than fails when Tk or a display is missing, so the hermetic
suite is unaffected; CI runs it under ``xvfb`` in a job of its own. A skip here
means "not checked", so the CI job asserts it actually ran.

Running it locally, on a machine that has Tk::

    python -m pytest tests/test_gui_smoke.py -v

Windows flash open and closed while it runs; that is the suite working. If every
test reports ``SKIPPED``, Tk or the display is missing and nothing was checked --
``python -c "import tkinter; tkinter.Tk()"`` will say which.
