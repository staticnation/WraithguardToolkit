"""Tests for the TES3 format schema and the annotations built on it.

The schema is generated out of prose tables written by people, so the important
question is not "does it load" but "is what it says *true*". Two checks answer
that without any hand-maintained expected values:

* every struct layout that could be parsed must add up to the byte count the
  same table declares for it -- 56 independent agreements, each one a chance for
  the parser to have gone wrong and not taken;
* every record type the diff window can encounter must resolve to a documented
  record, or be a type the reference is known not to cover.

The generator itself is tested against small synthetic tables, so its edge cases
(notes between the header and the fields, the ``uint32 = Flags`` typo, arrays
whose element layout is documented once) are pinned by construction rather than
by the current contents of the export.
