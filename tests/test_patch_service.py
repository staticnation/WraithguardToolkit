"""build_record_patch's orchestration -- the guard rails, the progress lines
each stage contributes, and _write's real subprocess call to tes3conv.

test_patch_merge.py already exercises the merge-vs-selection clash refusal
and dry_run paths as a side effect of testing merging itself. What's new
here: the "nothing selected" guard, collect()'s own PatchError surfacing as
PatchServiceError, the dialogue-risk/position-shift/anchor note lines (never
triggered by the simple two-plugin fixture those tests use), the missing-
master-size guard, EmitError surfacing, and _write end to end -- including
an actual tes3conv invocation, not just dry_run=True.

Reuses test_patch_merge.py's CASTLE/OTHER/PATCH fixture shape rather than
inventing a new one, so both files agree on what a real plugin pair looks
like.
