"""Carrying a record into a patch without repointing every object in it.

A record patch works by the engine's own rule: last definition of a record
wins, whole. So a patch carries the chosen plugin's record verbatim and loads
last, and everything it does not carry still comes from the original mods. No
source file is opened for writing at any point.

The one thing that cannot be copied verbatim is a ``Cell``'s references.
``mast_index`` is a *position*, not a name -- ``0`` is the file being read and
``k >= 1`` is the ``k``-th master of that file. Moving the record into a patch
changes what position 0 means and renumbers everything after it. Copied
unchanged, every placed object in that cell comes to mean a different file, and
nothing reports it.

Measured on real plugins: ``Clean Solstheim_Castle_v1.1`` declares three
masters and uses indices 0-3, 11,972 references sitting at 0; ``Bloodmoon``
declares one master and all 26,473 of its references sit at 0.
