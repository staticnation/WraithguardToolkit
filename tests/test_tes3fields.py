"""Verify the LAND / PGRD field decoders used by the diff window.

Fixtures here are **built from the documented format**, with answers known by
construction: an all-ones height-delta grid must reconstruct to a known plane,
and UESP's own worked path-grid example must produce the adjacency it
documents. Synthetic input is used deliberately -- the answers are exact, and
no third-party mod data is committed to this repository.

The decoders were **separately validated against real plugins** in the
workspace, which is what settled the two questions synthetic data cannot
answer. Those findings are recorded in ``CODE_REVIEW.md`` §22:

* Every subrecord is exactly its documented size (VNML 12,675, VHGT 4,232,
  WNAM 81, VCLR 12,675, VTEX 512).
* Reconstructed heights bottom out at exactly **-2048**, the format's
  documented default-height sentinel, and stay in a plausible terrain range.
* Path grids: the sum of every point's connection count equals the edge count
  **exactly** (282 = 282 on the first record checked), confirming both the
  byte offset of that field and the slicing model.
* VTEX de-swizzling raises adjacent-cell agreement from 0.714 to 0.852 across
  **2,190** non-uniform cells, winning in **97%** individually.

Re-running that validation needs only a plugin with LAND/PGRD records; the
extraction is a dozen lines of ``struct.unpack_from`` over the record stream.
