"""Check the BSA reader against a real Morrowind archive.

The reader's own tests build a synthetic archive and read it back, which proves
the reader and the test writer agree -- and nothing more. Both encode the same
understanding of the format, so a wrong understanding passes cleanly. This
checks against an archive Bethesda actually shipped, which is the only thing
that can find that class of error.

What it verifies:

* the index parses and holds a plausible number of files;
* every entry lies inside the file, which is what a wrong table offset breaks;
* names look like asset paths rather than binary noise, which is what a wrong
  *name table* offset breaks while leaving the sizes looking fine;
* extracted bytes carry the right magic for their extension -- a ``.dds`` that
  does not start with ``DDS `` means the data offset is wrong even though every
  other number looked right.

That last one matters most: an index can be entirely self-consistent and still
point at the wrong place.

Usage:
    python tools/check_bsa.py "E:/OpenMW/Morrowind/Data Files/Morrowind.bsa"
