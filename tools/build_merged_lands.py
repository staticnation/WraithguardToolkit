r"""Build a ``Merged Lands.esp`` that recovers terrain a load order discards.

**What it produces.** One plugin holding ``LTEX`` and ``LAND`` records for
every exterior cell more than one mod edits. Place it last in the load order.
Where two mods changed different vertices of the same cell, both survive; where
they changed the same vertex, a strategy decides (see
:mod:`wraithguard.land.merge`).

**What it does not touch.** References, objects, NPCs, scripts, interiors.
Cells are read for their terrain and nothing else, so everything else in the
load order resolves exactly as it did before. The output is additive: your mods
are never modified, and deleting the merged plugin restores the previous
behaviour completely.

**The safety argument, such as it is.** The binary encoding is done by
``tes3conv`` rather than by code written here, and
``tools/check_plugin_roundtrip.py`` established that its conversion converges on
real plugins. Every grid this writes was verified to decode back identically on
real cells. That is a good position, and it is still a new file being loaded by
a game -- so back up your saves before playing with a merged plugin for the
first time, and read the summary this prints rather than trusting it silently.

**Load order matters.** Texture indices resolve against the load order, and a
merge performed in the wrong order paints terrain with the wrong textures. Pass
``--order`` with a real plugin list. Without one the tool falls back to
alphabetical and says so, which is fine for a dry run and not for a plugin you
intend to play with.

Usage:
    python tools/build_merged_lands.py "E:/OpenMW/Morrowind/Data Files" --dry-run
    python tools/build_merged_lands.py "E:/.../Data Files" --order plugins.txt
    python tools/build_merged_lands.py --json-dir tes3conv_json --order plugins.txt \
        --out "E:/.../Data Files/Merged Lands.esp"
