"""Report names a module loads but neither imports nor defines.

Written during the module split, after relocating code produced a `NameError`
at runtime twice: once for `strip_comment`, once for `datetime`. A test run
reports the *first* missing name; this reports *all* of them, so a relocation
can be fixed in one pass instead of one failure at a time.

Deliberately conservative -- it over-collects locally bound names rather than
risk false positives, since a checker that cries wolf gets ignored. It models
closures and lambda parameters; getting those wrong produced fifteen false
positives on first use, which is exactly how such a tool stops being trusted.

Not a substitute for the linter. Ruff's ``F821`` catches things this misses
(a stale reference in an ``except`` branch, for one) and the two fail in
different directions, so run both.

Usage:
    python tools/check_undefined.py wraithguard/net/updaters.py [more.py ...]

Exits non-zero if anything is reported.
