"""Verify ``%(name)s`` keys in marked strings match their ``% {...}`` dicts.

A mistyped placeholder key is a **runtime** ``KeyError``:

    _("Loaded %(count)d files") % {"cont": n}      # KeyError: 'count'

Nothing else catches this. The CLI's print sites are only partially asserted by
the suite, and the GUI has no automated coverage at all -- a bad key there
surfaces only when a user clicks the thing. This converts that whole class of
error from "user finds it" to "linter finds it" (CODE_REVIEW.md §17).

For every ``_("...") % {...}`` and ``ngettext("...", "...", n) % {...}`` it
checks, in both directions:

* **missing key** -- a ``%(name)s`` in the format string with no matching key
  in the dict literal (the ``KeyError`` case);
* **unused key** -- a dict key no placeholder consumes (harmless at runtime,
  but almost always a typo'd twin of a missing key);
* **positional placeholder** -- bare ``%s``/``%d`` in a marked string.
  Translators reorder words, and positional conversions cannot be reordered;
  ``locale/README.md`` requires named placeholders, so this enforces it.

Like ``check_undefined.py`` it is deliberately conservative: only the direct
``<marker call> % <dict literal>`` pattern is checked. A dict built in a
variable first cannot be verified statically and is reported as unverifiable
rather than guessed at.

Usage:
    python tools/check_placeholders.py                  # scan the shipped sources
    python tools/check_placeholders.py some_file.py     # scan specific files

Exits non-zero if anything is reported.
