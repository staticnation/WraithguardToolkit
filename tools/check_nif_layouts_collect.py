"""Check the NIF layouts against real meshes.

``tests/test_nif.py`` builds its fixtures from the same understanding of the
format that the reader uses, so it proves the walker keeps its place but cannot
prove the layouts are *right*. Only real files can do that, and real files are
somebody's mod rather than something to commit here.

So this walks a folder of ``.nif`` files and reports how far the reader got in
each. Read the output as a survey, not a pass/fail:

* **Unknown block type** is expected and benign for types not yet in the table.
  The name tells you what to add next, and the frequency tells you whether it is
  worth adding.
* **A parse error part-way through a file whose blocks are all known** is the
  signal that matters. It almost always means a field width is wrong somewhere
  earlier -- a NIF block has no length, so a bad width does not fail where the
  mistake is, it fails a little downstream.
* **A type name full of punctuation** in the "unknown" column is the same
  symptom seen from the other side: the reader is no longer aligned to a real
  type string and is reading arbitrary bytes as one.

**A corpus built for this beats a corpus of real meshes.** The community's
*Notes for Modmakers* ships an attachments folder of NIFs each demonstrating
one specific block type. Those are far better subjects than vanilla meshes: the
type under test is isolated, you know in advance what the file contains, and a
failure names one layout rather than one of forty. Point the survey at that
folder and read the "parsed successfully" list -- on a demo corpus that list
*is* the coverage report.

Vanilla and mod folders remain worth surveying afterwards, because they answer
a different question: not "is this layout right" but "which types actually
occur, and how often".

Usage::

    python tools/check_nif_layouts.py "path/to/notes-attachments"
    python tools/check_nif_layouts.py "E:/Mods/SomeMod/Meshes"
    python tools/check_nif_layouts.py "E:/Mods" --limit 500
    python tools/check_nif_layouts.py "path/to/one.nif" --explain

Exits non-zero only if it could not read the folder at all; an incomplete parse
is information, not a failure.

    """Compare what the reader finds against a known-correct block census.

    The survey answers "did it finish". This answers "was it *right*", which is
    a different and stricter question: a file can walk to the end and still
    have mis-identified blocks along the way, and nothing about a clean parse
    would say so.

    Three outcomes, and the third is the one worth the trouble:

    * **agrees** -- every type and count matches.
    * **short** -- we found a subset, because the read stopped early. Expected
      while types are missing, and not a correctness problem.
    * **exceeds** -- we walked to the end and still reported more than the
      census lists.

    The census is known to undercount *property* blocks specifically --
    ``NiMaterialProperty`` in 1,513 of 1,757 cases, plus the alpha, texturing
    and z-buffer properties -- while matching a raw byte scan exactly on every
    other type. A scan that counts length-prefixed type strings and uses no
    layout knowledge at all agrees with this reader on 43 of 43 sampled
    property disagreements, and NifSkope agrees with both. So excess on a
    property type is the reference being wrong, not the reader.

    The third was originally called a *misparse*, on the assumption that the
    census was ground truth. It is not, and that assumption was checked rather
    than trusted: ``c/amulet_common_1.nif`` opened in NifSkope holds fifteen
    blocks, two of them ``NiMaterialProperty`` -- block 4 shared by shapes 1
    and 6, block 11 shared by shapes 10 and 13. The reader finds two. The
    census records one, while counting ``NiTexturingProperty`` in the same file
    correctly at two. Whatever generated it collapses some shared blocks and
    not others.

    So an excess is evidence about *either* party, and the tool no longer names
    a culprit. What it still does reliably is bound the disagreement and point
    at a file, which is enough to settle any individual case in NifSkope in
    about ten seconds. A *shortfall* remains meaningful in one direction: the
    census never invents blocks, so a type it lists and the reader never
    reaches is a genuine gap.

            anywhere. Terminal output truncates and has to be copied by hand;

        collect_dir: Where to copy a stratified sample of the most informative
            files, if anywhere. A layout cannot be fixed from a summary -- it
            needs the bytes -- and hand-picking files from a 7,000-line report
