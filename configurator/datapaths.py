"""Insert ``data=`` paths at the right place in a cfg.

OpenMW resolves loose files through a virtual file system layered in ``data=``
order, so *where* a path is inserted changes which file wins a conflict.
Anchors are inferred from the plugins a directory actually contains, so an
inserted path lands next to the mod it belongs with rather than at the end.

    """Guess an anchor for ``data=`` inserts that arrived without one.

    Looks at what is actually in the folder: if it holds a plugin that also
    appears in the sorted ``final_order``, the ``data=`` line is anchored next
    to whichever existing (frozen) ``data=`` path owns the nearest neighbouring
    plugin in that order. The result is that an inserted path lands beside the
    mod it belongs with instead of at the end of the file, which matters
    because VFS position decides which loose file wins.

    Only inserts with *no* anchor at all are touched. An explicit ``after`` or
    ``before`` written in the TOML is the user's stated intent and is always
    left alone; this is a best-effort fallback, not a correction.

    Every lookup is independently guarded. A folder that cannot be scanned, or
    a plugin absent from ``final_order``, falls through to the existing
    "no anchor -> append at end" behaviour in :func:`insert_data_paths` rather
    than raising.

    Guarded against duplicates: an insert whose path already matches an
