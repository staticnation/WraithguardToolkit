"""Simulate momw-configurator's apply step before it runs for real.

A faithful re-implementation of ``ApplyCustomizations`` from the Configurator's
``cfg/custom.go``, so the TOML this tool emits can be dry-run against a cfg
*before* the user runs the real thing. Fidelity to the Go source matters more
than elegance here -- including its sharp edges:

* inserts match by whole-line substring; zero matches is a per-entry error,
  more than one is fatal (the Go code returns a nil cfg);
* replaces match the same way, but more than one match skips the entry;
* removals are silent when they match nothing.

Reproducing those behaviours is the point. A "better" implementation that
resolved ambiguity differently would make the preview a lie.
