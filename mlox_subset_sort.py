r"""mlox_subset_sort.py.

Sorts ONLY a subset of plugins (your "custom" mods, e.g. the ones you added
via a umo/momw-customizations.toml file) into an existing openmw.cfg,
using an mlox-format rules database (mlox_base.txt / mlox_user.txt / whatever
`plox` downloads) to decide where they belong.

The existing content= order already in openmw.cfg is treated as FROZEN --
this script never reorders plugins that are already correctly sorted (e.g.
by momw-configurator + plox). It only figures out, for the subset plugins,
where they need to slot in relative to the frozen list and to each other.

By default this tool only PRINTS its plan -- it writes nothing. Pass
--write-cfg to patch openmw.cfg directly, and/or --emit-toml to write a
corrected momw-customizations.toml (the durable fix -- feed it back into
momw-configurator/umo so the order survives future rebuilds, instead of
being overwritten by the next rebuild like a direct cfg patch would be).

After sorting, [Requires], [Conflict], and [Note] rules from the same
rule files are also evaluated (read-only) against the final active plugin
list and printed as warnings -- e.g. "you have A and B active, and they
conflict" or "A requires B, which is missing". These are informational
only: nothing is auto-fixed or blocked because of them, and (like the
sorting rules) they are parsed by a best-effort mlox-logic interpreter,
not the real mlox engine, so treat them as a hint to go check things
yourself rather than ground truth. Pass --no-predicate-warnings to skip
this step entirely.

Also by default, only content= plugins are sorted (via mlox). data=
(folder path) insertions from --customizations are found but NOT acted on
unless you pass --sort-data-paths -- since those aren't ordered by mlox at
all, this is opt-in so you don't get surprise data= reordering from a run
that was only meant to sort plugins.

When --sort-data-paths IS given, an explicit after/before anchor you wrote
in the TOML always wins. For any insert with NO anchor, the folder itself
is scanned (non-recursively) for .esp/.esm/etc files; if it contains a
plugin that's also somewhere in the mlox-sorted content order, the data=
line is anchored next to whichever existing data= path owns the nearest
neighboring plugin in that order -- e.g. a mod folder holding NewMod.esp
gets its data= line placed next to the data= path that holds whatever
mlox decided goes right before/after NewMod.esp in content=. Every step of
that (path doesn't exist, folder has no plugins, plugin isn't part of this
run's sort, ...) is guarded to fall through to the old "no anchor ->
appended at the end" behavior rather than fail the run.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  # Preview only (default) -- prints the plan, writes nothing
  python3 mlox_subset_sort.py \
      --cfg "C:\\Games\\OpenMW\\openmw.cfg" \
      --rules ".\\mlox\\mlox_base.txt" ".\\mlox\\mlox_user.txt" \
      --customizations "C:\\Games\\OpenMW\\momw-customizations.toml"

  # Write a corrected customizations TOML (recommended, durable fix)
  python3 mlox_subset_sort.py \
      --cfg openmw.cfg --rules mlox/mlox_base.txt \
      --customizations momw-customizations.toml \
      --emit-toml momw-customizations.toml

  # Patch openmw.cfg directly instead/also (one-off, gets overwritten on next rebuild)
  python3 mlox_subset_sort.py \
      --cfg openmw.cfg --rules mlox/mlox_base.txt \
      --customizations momw-customizations.toml --write-cfg

A timestamped backup of openmw.cfg is written next to the original before
--write-cfg makes any change (unless --no-backup is also given).

Rule files passed later on the command line are treated as higher priority
(mirrors mlox's own mlox_user.txt-overrides-mlox_base.txt behaviour) --
so pass mlox_base.txt first, mlox_user.txt last.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
RULE-ENGINE FIDELITY (how close this is to real mlox)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The rule parsing and matching are ported from mlox itself (and cross-checked
against plox), so several things behave exactly like the real engine:
- Filename matching handles '*' and '?' wildcards AND the <VER> version-number
  token, with the same metacharacter escaping mlox uses.
- [Order] chains bridge over plugins you don't have: [Order] A, B, C with B
  not installed still enforces A before C (mlox keeps a phantom node; we chain
  the surviving neighbours -- same effect on your installed plugins).
- [Requires]/[Conflict]/[Note] warnings understand ALL/ANY/NOT/DESC nesting
  and the [VER]/[SIZE]/[DESC] functions (reading real plugin version/size/
  header description from the cfg's data= folders; conservative fallback when
  those files aren't reachable). [MWSE-LUA] is parsed but treated as N/A under
  OpenMW. [Patch]/[Version] blocks are parsed only well enough to skip cleanly.

Still deliberately different from full mlox (by design):
- SORTING only ever repositions the subset; the existing content= order in
  openmw.cfg is treated as FROZEN and never reordered. This is the whole point
  (don't disturb a curated MOMW list), not a shortcoming.
- [Requires]/[Conflict]/[Note] are read-only: they print warnings, never change
  the order or block anything. Treat warnings as a prompt to go check, not gospel.
- [NearStart]/[NearEnd] become ordering chains among the listed plugins, not a
  hard push to the absolute start/end of the file.
- data= (folder path) insertions are placed by their after/before anchor (mlox
  has no concept of data-path order). An anchor must point at an EXISTING data=
  line; if not found, the path is appended at the end with a warning.

See README.md for the full feature tour (plugin-order.yml integration, the
mods-folder scanner, and the GUI).

#     *      -> any run of characters
#     ?      -> any single character
#     <VER>  -> a version number (e.g. matches the "1.2" in "Foo 1.2.esp")

# this tool used fnmatch, which has no concept of <VER> -- so the ~578 rule

# any installed plugin, and every ordering edge those rules would have created
