"""mlox_subset_sort_gui.py.

A small drag-and-drop GUI front-end for mlox_subset_sort.py. It doesn't
reimplement any sorting/warning logic itself -- it just builds the same
arguments the CLI would take and calls into mlox_subset_sort directly, and
streams that call's normal console output into a log panel (colorizing
warnings/errors as it goes) instead of you needing to remember flag names
and read a terminal.

Workflow is two steps, matching mlox_subset_sort's compute_plan()/
write_plan() split:
  1. Sort -- runs mlox, evaluates warnings, and populates a "Plugin Load
     Order" list you can drag rows up/down in to manually override anything
     mlox got wrong (or just prefer differently) before committing to it.
  2. Export -- writes openmw.cfg and/or the corrected customizations.toml
     using whatever order the list is in at that point (mlox's own order,
     if you never touched it).

Also here (all optional, all wired straight into the same core functions):
  - Scan... -- generate the subset by walking a mods folder (folds in the old
    mod_scan.py). With "Create subset text document" on it writes a .txt you
    pick; off, it keeps the result in memory just for this session.
  - a list-name field and a plugin-order.yml field -- when both are set, MOMW's
    curated list for that name is told apart from your custom additions.
  - hamburger-style grips on the pane dividers (drag to resize the panels).

Cross-platform: pure Python + tkinter, runs on Windows, Linux and macOS.

Requirements:
    pip install tkinterdnd2 --break-system-packages   (optional -- drag & drop)
    - tkinter ships with the python.org installers on Windows/macOS.
    - On Linux install it via your package manager, e.g.
      Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt install python3-tk
    - PyYAML is optional (a built-in parser is used if it's absent).

If tkinterdnd2 isn't installed, the GUI still runs -- you just lose
drag-and-drop of files from your OS (dragging rows within the app's own
lists to reorder them doesn't need tkinterdnd2, so that always works) and
have to use the "Browse..." buttons instead for file inputs.

Run it with:
    python3 mlox_subset_sort_gui.py

This file must sit next to mlox_subset_sort.py (it imports it directly
rather than shelling out, so results, exceptions, etc. all stay in-process).
